	abstract = {In the summer of 1983 a group of scientists working in the fields of meteorology, biology, and remote sensing met to discuss methods for modeling and observing land-surface—atmosphere interactions on regional and global scales. They concluded, first, that the existing climate models contained poor representations of the processes controlling the exchanges of energy, water, heat, and carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere and, second, that satellite remote sensing had been underutilized as a means of specifying global fields of the governing biophysical parameters. Accordingly, a multiscale, multidisciplinary experiment, {FIFE}, was initiated to address these two issues. The objectives of {FIFE} were specified as follows: (1) Upscale integration of models: The experiment was designed to test the soil-plant-atmosphere models developed by biometeorologists for small-scale applications (millimeters to meters) and to develop methods to apply them at the larger scales (kilometers) appropriate to atmospheric models and satellite remote sensing. (2) Application of satellite remote sensing: Even if the first goal were achieved to yield a “perfect” model of vegetation-atmosphere exchanges, it would have very limited applications without a global observing system for initialization and validation. As a result, the experiment was tasked with exploring methods for using satellite data to quantify important biophysical states and rates for model input. The experiment was centered on a 15 × 15 km grassland site near Manhattan, Kansas. This area became the focus for an extended monitoring program of satellite, meteorological, biophysical, and hydrological data acquisition from early 1987 through October 1989 and a series of 12- to 20-day intensive field campaigns ({IFCs}), four in 1987 and one in 1989. During the {IFCs} the fluxes of heat, moisture, carbon dioxide, and radiation were measured with surface and airborne equipment in coordination with measurements of surface and atmospheric parameters and satellite overpasses. The resulting data are held in a single integrated data base and continue to be analyzed by the participating scientists and others. The first two sections of this paper recount the history and scientific background leading up to {FIFE}; the third and fourth sections review the experiment design, the scientific teams and equipment involved, and the actual execution of the experiment; the fifth section provides an overview of the contents of this special issue; the sixth section summarizes the management and resources of the project; and the last section lists the acknowledgments.},

	abstract = {This is the second part of a study on the cold season process modeling in the North American Land Data Assimilation System ({NLDAS}). The first part concentrates on the assessment of model simulated snow cover extent. In this second part, the focus is on the evaluation of simulated snow water equivalent ({SWE}) from the four land surface models (Noah, {MOSAIC}, {SAC} and {VIC}) in the {NLDAS}. Comparisons are made with observational data from the Natural Resources Conservation Service's Snowpack Telemetry ({SNO}℡) network for a 3-year retrospective period at selected sites in the mountainous regions of the western United States. All models show systematic low bias in the maximum annual simulated {SWE} that is most notable in the Cascade and Sierra Nevada regions where differences can approach 1000 mm. Comparison of {NLDAS} precipitation forcing with {SNO}℡ measurements revealed a large bias in the {NLDAS} annual precipitation which may be lower than the {SNO}℡ record by up to 2000 mm at certain stations. Experiments with the {VIC} model indicated that most of the bias in {SWE} is removed by scaling the precipitation by a regional factor based on the regression of the {NLDAS} and {SNO}℡ precipitation. Individual station errors may be reduced further still using precipitation scaled to the local station {SNO}℡ record. Furthermore, the {NLDAS} air temperature is shown to be generally colder in winter months and biased warmer in spring and summer when compared to the {SNO}℡ record, although the level of bias is regionally dependent. Detailed analysis at a selected station indicate that errors in the air temperature forcing may cause the partitioning of precipitation into snowfall and rainfall by the models to be incorrect and thus may explain some of the remaining errors in the simulated {SWE}.},

	abstract = {The North American Land Data Assimilation System ({NLDAS}) phase 2 ({NLDAS}-2) has generated 31-years (1979–2008) of water and energy products from four state-of-the-art land surface models (Noah, Mosaic, {SAC}, {VIC}). The soil moisture data from these models have been used for operational drought monitoring activities, but so far have not yet been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, three available in situ soil moisture observation data sets in the United States were used to evaluate the model-simulated soil moisture for different time scales varying from daily to annual. First, we used the observed multiple layer monthly and annual mean soil moisture from the Illinois Climate Network to evaluate 20-years (January 1985–December 2004) of model-simulated soil moisture in terms of skill and analysis of error statistics. Second, we utilized 6-years (1 January 1997–31 December 2002) of daily soil moisture observed from 72 sites over the Oklahoma Mesonet network to assess daily and monthly simulation skill and errors for 3 model soil layers (0–10cm, 10–40cm, 40–100cm). Third, we extended the daily assessment to sites over the continental United States using 8-years (1 January 2002–31 December 2009) of observations for 121 sites from the Soil Climate Analysis Network ({SCAN}). Overall, all models are able to capture wet and dry events and show high skill (in most cases, anomaly correlation is larger than 0.7), but display large biases when compared to in situ observations. These errors may come from model errors (i.e., model structure error, model parameter error), forcing data errors, and in situ soil moisture measurement errors. For example, all models simulate less soil moisture due to lack of modeled irrigation and ground water processes in Illinois, Oklahoma, and the other Midwest states.},

	abstract = {Abstract A negative snow water equivalent ({SWE}) bias in the snow model of the Noah land surface scheme used in the {NCEP} suite of numerical weather and climate prediction models has been noted by several investigators. This bias motivated a series of offline tests of model extensions and improvements intended to reduce or eliminate the bias. These improvements consist of changes to the model’s albedo formulation that include a parameterization for snowpack aging, changes to how pack temperature is computed, and inclusion of a provision for refreeze of liquid water in the pack. Less extensive testing was done on the performance of model extensions with alternate areal depletion parameterizations. Model improvements were evaluated through comparisons of point simulations with National Resources Conservation Service ({NRCS}) Snowpack Telemetry ({SNOTEL}) {SWE} data for deep-mountain snowpacks at selected stations in the western United States, as well as simulations of snow areal extent over the conterminous United States ({CONUS}) domain, compared with observational data from the {NOAA} Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System ({IMS}). The combination of snow-albedo decay and liquid-water refreeze results in substantial improvements in the magnitude and timing of peak {SWE}, as well as increased snow-covered extent at large scales. Modifications to areal snow depletion thresholds yielded more realistic snow-covered albedos at large scales.},

A 1-year study period was used. Rn, {LH}, {SH} and {GH} data from seven sites were screened based on an energy balance closure criterion (daily/hourly sum of the flux components within the range of −10 to +10 W m−2). The vegetation fraction used in the model was computed using both the Gutman-Ignatov (G-I) and the Carlson-Ripley (C-R) schemes. The simulated net radiation and ground heat fluxes seem less sensitive to the choice of schemes for computing green vegetation fraction, while latent and sensible heat flux show more sensitivity particularly for soil dry-down period. Therefore, the G-I approach was used for the validation study, as it is widely used and linear in its form. The daily aggregated model outputs showed that the predicted Rn had a positive bias of 0.8 {MJ} m−2 d−1 and an {RMSE} of 1.6 {MJ} m−2 d−1 when averaged over all seven sites. The seven-site average bias in {LH} was about 0.9 {MJ} m−2 d−1 with an {RMSE} of 2.5 {MJ} m−2 d−1. The bias in {SH} and {GH} was low and positive with an {RMSE} of about 2.2 {MJ} m−2 d−1 in {SH} estimation. The hourly average output showed similar results, with the exception that {GH} had a negative bias.

Soil properties displayed large variability with depth and location within and among sites. Variability of soil properties helped determine and interpret soil moisture variability. The objective of this study was to provide direct measurements of soil properties for 70 of the 114 {US} Climate Reference Network ({USCRN}) sites across the continental United States. Soil properties determined from the analysis of soil core samples include the particle size distribution ({PSD}, consisting of sand, silt, and clay contents), soil texture classifications, bulk density ({BD}), and the soil moisture content at water potentials of 33 {kPa} (field capacity, {FC}) and 1500 {kPa} (wilting point, {WP}). Sand, silt, and clay contents of the 70 sites indicated about 10 soil texture classifications as follows: three sites with loamy sand, 15 with sandy loam, two with clay, 11 with silt loam, five with clay loam, 10 with loam, seven with sand, eight with silty clay loam, four with sandy clay, and three with silty clay. The comparison of soil properties among soil depths and pits indicated considerable variability, with the silt, clay, and sand contents varying more with soil depth than with location at individual sites. The silt content tended to decrease with soil depth, clay tended to increase, and sand tended to vary randomly with depth. Regression lines fitted to values of {FC} and {WP} between the pits indicated a slope {\textgreater} 0.8, R2 {\textgreater} 0.88, and {RMSE} ranging from 2.7 to 4\%. Compared with {FC} and {WP}, {BD} was less consistent among the pits, with slope = 0.6, R2 = 0.4, and {RMSE} of about 0.2 g cm−3.},

	abstract = {Despite significant recent developments in computational power and distributed hydrologic modeling, the issue of how to adequately address the uncertainty associated with hydrological predictions remains a critical and challenging one. This issue needs to be properly addressed for hydrological modeling to realize its maximum practical potential in environmental decision-making processes. Arguably, the key to properly addressing hydrologic uncertainty is to understand, quantify, and reduce uncertainty involved in hydrologic modeling in a cohesive, systematic manner. Although general principles and techniques on addressing hydrologic uncertainty are emerging in the literature, there exist no well-accepted guidelines about how to actually implement these principles and techniques in various hydrologic settings in an integrated manner. This paper reviews, in relevant detail, the common data assimilation methods that have been used in hydrologic modeling to address problems of state estimation, parameter estimation, and system identification. In particular, the paper discusses concepts, methods, and issues involved in hydrologic data assimilation from a systems perspective. An integrated hierarchical framework is proposed for pursuing hydrologic data assimilation in several progressive steps to maximally reduce uncertainty in hydrologic predictions.},

Representative parameters for the moisture characteristic, the wetting front suction, and the sorptivity, a parameter in the infiltration equation derived by Philip (1957), are computed by using the desorption data of Holtan et al. (1968). Average values of the parameters, and associated standard deviations, are calculated for 11 soil textural classes.

The standard {NLDAS} models do a fairly good job but with differences in the surface energy partition and in soil moisture between models and observations and among models during the summer, while they agree quite well on the soil temperature simulations. To investigate why, we performed a series of experiments accounting for differences between model-specified soil types and vegetation and those observed at the stations, and differences in model treatment of different soil types, vegetation properties, canopy resistance, soil column depth, rooting depth, root density, snow-free albedo, infiltration, aerodynamic resistance, and soil thermal diffusivity.

Interpolation procedures for the continuous and categorical variables describing these soil properties were developed and applied to the original {STATSGO} data.

In this paper, we delve into this question by examining the relation between training and testing loss in neural networks. Through visualization of these losses, we note that the training trajectory with a large learning rate navigates through the minima manifold of the training loss, finally nearing the neighborhood of the testing loss minimum. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a nonlinear model whose loss landscapes mirror those observed for real neural networks. Upon investigating the training process using {SGD} on our model, we demonstrate that an extended phase with a large learning rate steers our model towards the minimum norm solution of the training loss, which may achieve near-optimal generalization, thereby affirming the empirically observed benefits of late learning rate decay.},

	abstract = {It is known that the learning rate is the most important hyper-parameter to tune for training deep neural networks. This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate "reasonable bounds" - linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the {CIFAR}-10 and {CIFAR}-100 datasets with {ResNets}, Stochastic Depth networks, and {DenseNets}, and the {ImageNet} dataset with the {AlexNet} and {GoogLeNet} architectures. These are practical tools for everyone who trains neural networks.},

	abstract = {A recapitulation of the main features of the moisture distribution in an ideal soil is given in order to emphasise a point previously neglected, namely, that the changes are not in the main strictly reversible, but fall into two series corresponding to the two directions of moisture change. The cellular nature of the soil pore space imposes a quantum character on the moisture changes over a great part of the higher moisture range. The individual cell does not fill or empty by smooth reversible changes but shows two unstable stages at which filling or emptying is completed at a bound. For falling moisture the suction level is that at which a meniscus can invade a cell through one of its narrow entries, which gives a value in the neighbourhood of 12 T/r for close packing. For rising moisture the suction level is that for which water returns to the cell by the collapse of a bubble in it, giving a lower value in the neighbourhood of 6·9 T/r. A still lower value of 4·5 T/r can be reached for a particular type of distribution confined to the lower moisture range.All the above suction values are closely verified by measurements made with bronze balls and paraffin oil. A detailed exploration of the case for glistening dew and water has been made, which verifies the theory while illustrating more nearly the behaviour of an irregular soil. The two values which rule the two halves of the “hysteresis loop” for this case of natural or common packing are 6·0 T/r for falling moisture and 4·0 T/r for rising.The new considerations resolve the differences of opinion raised by R. A. Fisher. It appears that the author has throughout supported a case which belongs correctly to the falling moisture series. Fisher considered a very limited series for the rising moisture case and a hypothetical reversible series, and has been in error in so far as his treatment was regarded as exclusive.},

We outline a framework for measuring information in models, observations, and evaluation data in a way that allows us to quantify information loss during (necessarily imperfect) data assimilation. This facilitates quantitative analysis of trade-offs between improving (usually expensive) remote sensing observing systems versus improving data assimilation design and implementation. We demonstrate this methodology on a previously published application of the ensemble Kalman filter used to assimilate remote sensing soil moisture retrievals from Advanced Microwave Scattering Radiometer for Earth ({AMSR}-E) into the Noah land surface model.},

Parameters dominated uncertainty in soil moisture estimates and forcing data dominated uncertainty in evapotranspiration estimates; however, the models themselves used only a fraction of the information available to them. This means that there is significant potential to improve all three components of {NLDAS}-2.

Here, we present a diagnostically interesting decomposition of {NSE} (and hence {MSE}), which facilitates analysis of the relative importance of its different components in the context of hydrological modelling, and show how model calibration problems can arise due to interactions among these components. The analysis is illustrated by calibrating a simple conceptual precipitation-runoff model to daily data for a number of Austrian basins having a broad range of hydro-meteorological characteristics. Evaluation of the results clearly demonstrates the problems that can be associated with any calibration based on the {NSE} (or {MSE}) criterion. While we propose and test an alternative criterion that can help to reduce model calibration problems, the primary purpose of this study is not to present an improved measure of model performance. Instead, we seek to show that there are systematic problems inherent with any optimization based on formulations related to the {MSE}. The analysis and results have implications to the manner in which we calibrate and evaluate environmental models; we discuss these and suggest possible ways forward that may move us towards an improved and diagnostically meaningful approach to model performance evaluation and identification.},

	abstract = {Simulated snowpack by the Noah land surface model ({LSM}) shows an early depletion due to excessive sublimation and too early onset of snowmelt. To mitigate these deficiencies, five model modifications are tested to improve snowpack performance: (1) time-varying snow albedo, (2) solar radiation adjustment for terrain slope and orientation, (3) reducing the surface exchange coefficient for stable boundary layers, (4) increase of fresh snow albedo, and (5) adjusting surface roughness length when snow is present. The Noah {LSM} is executed from 1 November 2007 to 1 August 2008 for the headwater region in the Colorado Rocky Mountains with complex terrain, and its results are evaluated against 1 km Snow Data Assimilation System ({SNODAS}) output and individual Natural Resources Conservation Service Snowpack Telemetry ({SNO}℡) sites. The most effective way to improve magnitude and timing of seasonal maximum snow water equivalent ({SWE}) is the introduction of the time-varying albedo formulation and the increase in fresh snow albedo. Minor improvement is obtained by reducing nighttime sublimation through adjusting the stable boundary layer surface exchange coefficient. Modifying the surface roughness length over snow surfaces and adding a terrain slope and orientation adjustment for radiation has little effect on average {SWE} conditions for the entire modeling domain, though it can have a significant effect in certain regions. The net effect of all changes is to improve the magnitude and timing of seasonal maximum {SWE}, but the snow period end is now somewhat too long. Adding the terrain slope and orientation effects does have an effect on local surface energy flux components depending on the cell slope and orientation.},

Because this puts enormous pressure on the I/O subsystem, the most common approach to distributed {SGD} in {HPC} environments is to replicate the entire dataset to node local {SSDs}. However, due to rapidly growing data set sizes this approach has become increasingly infeasible. Surprisingly, the questions of why and to what extent random access is required have not received a lot of attention in the literature from an empirical standpoint. In this paper, we revisit data shuffling in {DL} workloads to investigate the viability of partitioning the dataset among workers and performing only a partial distributed exchange of samples in each training epoch. Through extensive experiments on up to 2,048 {GPUs} of {ABCI} and 4,096 compute nodes of Fugaku, we demonstrate that in practice validation accuracy of global shuffling can be maintained when carefully tuning the partial distributed exchange. We provide a solution implemented in {PyTorch} that enables users to control the proposed data exchange scheme.},

We observe that standard performance evaluation metrics can be oblivious to distinguishing these diverse problem solving behaviors.

This helps to assess whether a learned model indeed delivers reliably for the problem that it was conceived for.

The Climate Prediction Center morphing method ({CMORPH}) uses motion vectors derived from half-hourly interval geostationary satellite {IR} imagery to propagate the relatively high quality precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave data. In addition, the shape and intensity of the precipitation features are modified (morphed) during the time between microwave sensor scans by performing a time-weighted linear interpolation. This process yields spatially and temporally complete microwave-derived precipitation analyses, independent of the infrared temperature field. {CMORPH} showed substantial improvements over both simple averaging of the microwave estimates and over techniques that blend microwave and infrared information but that derive estimates of precipitation from infrared data when passive microwave information is unavailable. In particular, {CMORPH} outperforms these blended techniques in terms of daily spatial correlation with a validating rain gauge analysis over Australia by an average of 0.14, 0.27, 0.26, 0.22, and 0.20 for April, May, June–August, September, and October 2003, respectively. {CMORPH} also yields higher equitable threat scores over Australia for the same periods by an average of 0.11, 0.14, 0.13, 0.14, and 0.13.

The objective techniques include the inverse-distance weighting algorithms of Cressman (1959) and Shepard (1968), and the optimal interpolation ({OI}) method of Gandin (1965). Intercomparisons and cross-validation tests are conducted to examine their performance over various parts of the globe where station network densities are different. The gauge data used in the examinations are quality controlled daily precipitation reports from roughly 16,000 stations over the global land areas that have been collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ({NOAA}) Climate Prediction Center ({CPC}). Data sources include daily summary files from the Global Telecommunication System ({GTS}), and the {CPC} unified daily gauge data sets over the contiguous United States ({CONUS}), Mexico, and South America. All three objective techniques are capable of generating useful daily precipitation analyses with biases of generally less than 1\% over most parts of the global land areas. The {OI} method consistently performs the best among the three techniques for almost all situations (regions, seasons, and network densities). The Shepard scheme compares reasonably well with the {OI}, while the Cressman method tends to generate smooth precipitation fields with wider raining areas relative to the station observations. The quality of the gauge-based analyses degrades as the network of station observations becomes sparser, although the {OI} technique exhibits relatively stable performance statistics over regions covered by fewer gauges.},

	abstract = {Simulating land surface hydrological states and fluxes requires a comprehensive set of atmospheric forcing data at consistent temporal and spatial scales. At the continental-to-global scale, such data are not available except in weather reanalysis products. Unfortunately, reanalysis products are often biased due to errors in the host weather forecast model. This paper explores whether the error in model predictions of the initial soil moisture status and hydrological fluxes can be minimized through a bias reduction scheme to the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast and National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis products. The bias reduction scheme uses both difference and ratio corrections based upon global observational data sets. Both the corrected and original forcing data were used to simulate land surface states and fluxes with a land surface model ({LSM}) over North America. Soil moisture, snow depth, and runoff output from the {LSM} are compared to observations to assess the impact of the bias correction on simulation accuracy. Results of this study demonstrate the sensitivity of {LSMs} to bias in the forcing data, and that implementation of a bias reduction scheme reduces errors to the simulation of soil moisture, runoff, and snow water equivalence. Accordingly, the initial soil moisture fields produced should be more representative of actual conditions, and therefore more useful to the climate modeling community. Results suggest that modelers using reanalysis products for forcing {LSMs}, in particular for the establishment of initial conditions, should consider a bias reduction strategy when preparing their input forcing fields.},

Extensive quality control and validation efforts have been conducted on the {NLDAS} forcing data sets, and favorable comparisons have taken place with Oklahoma Mesonet, Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program/cloud and radiation test bed, and Surface Radiation observation data.

A revised land surface hydrology (H-{TESSEL}) is introduced in the {ECMWF} operational model to address shortcomings of the land surface scheme, specifically the lack of surface runoff and the choice of a global uniform soil texture. New infiltration and runoff schemes are introduced with a dependency on the soil texture and standard deviation of orography. A set of experiments in stand-alone mode is used to assess the improved prediction of soil moisture at the local scale against field site observations. Comparison with basin-scale water balance ({BSWB}) and Global Runoff Data Centre ({GRDC}) datasets indicates a consistently larger dynamical range of land water mass over large continental areas and an improved prediction of river runoff, while the effect on atmospheric fluxes is fairly small. Finally, the {ECMWF} data assimilation and prediction systems are used to verify the effect on surface and near-surface quantities in the atmospheric-coupled mode. A midlatitude error reduction is seen both in soil moisture and in 2-m temperature.},

It consisted of the relevant meteorological parameters for Serbia, during the period 2011–2020. Daily values of maximum and minimum air temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure deficit were used as features, and they were fed to recurrent neural network in order to predict volumetric soil moisture for three days ahead. A Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) network was designed and trained at a regional scale using the data from the 2011–2016 period, at 28 locations that cover four major soil types. Validation was done on 2017–2018 data and {LSTM} was compared with a statistical forecasting technique and a classical machine learning approach. Evaluation was done with error measures commonly used in literature. The resulting network yielded the lowest errors and proved to have good generalisation properties. The system was tested from September 2019 to April 2020 using short-range weather forecasts of Yr service. It will present the cornerstone of the irrigation scheduling service in {AgroSense}.rs, the Serbian national platform for digital agriculture.},

	abstract = {The soil moisture is a quantity of paramount importance in the study of hydrologic phenomena and soil-atmosphere interaction. Because of its high spatial and temporal variability, the soil moisture monitoring scheme was investigated here both for soil moisture retrieval by remote sensing and in view of the use of soil moisture data in rainfall-runoff modeling. To this end, by using a portable Time Domain Reflectometer, a sequence of 35 measurement days were carried out within a single year in seven fields located inside the Vallaccia catchment, central Italy, with area of 60 km2. Every sampling day, soil moisture measurements were collected at each field over a regular grid with an extension of 2000 m2. The optimization of the monitoring scheme, with the aim of an accurate mean soil moisture estimation at the field and catchment scale, was addressed by the statistical and the temporal stability. At the field scale, the number of required samples ({NRS}) to estimate the field-mean soil moisture within an accuracy of 2\%, necessary for the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture, ranged between 4 and 15 for almost dry conditions (the worst case); at the catchment scale, this number increased to nearly 40 and it refers to almost wet conditions. On the other hand, to estimate the mean soil moisture temporal pattern, useful for rainfall-runoff modeling, the {NRS} was found to be lower. In fact, at the catchment scale only 10 measurements collected in the most “representative” field, previously determined through the temporal stability analysis, can reproduce the catchment-mean soil moisture with a determination coefficient, R2, higher than 0.96 and a root-mean-square error, {RMSE}, equal to 2.38\%. For the “nonrepresentative” fields the accuracy in terms of {RMSE} decreased, but similar R2 coefficients were found. This insight can be exploited for the sampling in a generic field when it is sufficient to know an index of soil moisture temporal pattern to be incorporated in conceptual rainfall-runoff models. The obtained results can address the soil moisture monitoring network design from which a reliable soil moisture temporal pattern at the catchment scale can be derived.},

This project was born out of a research-to-operations/operation-to-research (R2O/O2R) paradigm within {SPoRT} through extensive collaboration with National Weather Service ({NWS}) and River Forecast Center ({RFC}) forecasters. The original intention of Streamflow-{AI} was to provide accurate medium range ({\textgreater}2 days) forecasts of river flooding events that are particularly challenging for {NWS} forecasters, because routine streamflow forecasts may not incorporate quantitative precipitation forecast ({QPF}) data beyond one or two days.  Therefore, Streamflow-{AI} was designed to help fill the operational gap, producing routine 7 day river level forecasts using a suite of {QPFs}.  Throughout the evolution of the project, research efforts have been tailored to meet the needs of the end users.  This presentation will provide a brief overview of {NASA} {SPoRT}’s Streamflow-{AI} product, highlighting O2R/R2O concepts with a focus on recent developments including a 1-hr rapid update model and 15-min burn scar flooding modeling efforts.},

To produce this extension, we synthesized diverse and complementary data sets to describe six main classes of attributes at the catchment scale: topography, climate, streamflow, land cover, soil, and geology. The spatial variations among basins over the {CONUS} are discussed and compared using a series of maps. The large number of catchments, combined with the diversity of the attributes we extracted, makes this new data set well suited for large-sample studies and comparative hydrology. In comparison to the similar Model Parameter Estimation Experiment ({MOPEX}) data set, this data set relies on more recent data, it covers a wider range of attributes, and its catchments are more evenly distributed across the {CONUS}. This study also involves assessments of the limitations of the source data sets used to compute catchment attributes, as well as detailed descriptions of how the attributes were computed.

In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach, using the Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) network, a special type of recurrent neural network. The advantage of the {LSTM} is its ability to learn long-term dependencies between the provided input and output of the network, which are essential for modelling storage effects in e.g. catchments with snow inﬂuence. We use 241 catchments of the freely available {CAMELS} data set to test our approach and also compare the results to the well-known Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model ({SAC}-{SMA}) coupled with the Snow-17 snow routine. We also show the potential of the {LSTM} as a regional hydrological model in which one model predicts the discharge for a variety of catchments. In our last experiment, we show the possibility to transfer process understanding, learned at regional scale, to individual catchments and thereby increasing model performance when compared to a {LSTM} trained only on the data of single catchments. Using this approach, we were able to achieve better model performance as the {SAC}-{SMA} + Snow-17, which underlines the potential of the {LSTM} for hydrological modelling applications.},

By training a single {LSTM} model on 531 basins from the {CAMELS} dataset using meteorological time series data and static catchment attributes, we were able to significantly improve performance compared to a set of several different hydrological benchmark models. Our proposed approach not only significantly outperforms hydrological models that were calibrated regionally, but also achieves better performance than hydrological models that were calibrated for each basin individually. Furthermore, we propose an adaption to the standard {LSTM} architecture, which we call an Entity-Aware-{LSTM} ({EA}-{LSTM}), that allows for learning catchment similarities as a feature layer in a deep learning model.

	abstract = {Abstract. Neural networks have been shown to be extremely effective rainfall-runoff models, where the river discharge is predicted from meteorological inputs. However, the question remains: what have these models learned? Is it possible to extract information about the learned relationships that map inputs to outputs, and do these mappings represent known hydrological concepts? Small-scale experiments have demonstrated that the internal states of long short-term memory networks ({LSTMs}), a particular neural network architecture predisposed to hydrological modelling, can be interpreted. By extracting the tensors which represent the learned translation from inputs (precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration) to outputs (discharge), this research seeks to understand what information the {LSTM} captures about the hydrological system. We assess the hypothesis that the {LSTM} replicates real-world processes and that we can extract information about these processes from the internal states of the {LSTM}. We examine the cell-state vector, which represents the memory of the {LSTM}, and explore the ways in which the {LSTM} learns to reproduce stores of water, such as soil moisture and snow cover. We use a simple regression approach to map the {LSTM} state vector to our target stores (soil moisture and snow). Good correlations (R2{\textgreater}0.8) between the probe outputs and the target variables of interest provide evidence that the {LSTM} contains information that reflects known hydrological processes comparable with the concept of variable-capacity soil moisture stores. The implications of this study are threefold: (1) {LSTMs} reproduce known hydrological processes. (2) While conceptual models have theoretical assumptions embedded in the model a priori, the {LSTM} derives these from the data. These learned representations are interpretable by scientists. (3) {LSTMs} can be used to gain an estimate of intermediate stores of water such as soil moisture. While machine learning interpretability is still a nascent field and our approach reflects a simple technique for exploring what the model has learned, the results are robust to different initial conditions and to a variety of benchmarking experiments. We therefore argue that deep learning approaches can be used to advance our scientific goals as well as our predictive goals.},

	abstract = {Due to the increasing availability of large-scale observations and simulation datasets, data-driven representations arise as efficient and relevant computation representations of geophysical systems for a wide range of applications, where model-driven models based on ordinary differential equations remain the state-of-the-art approaches. In this work, we investigate neural networks ({NN}) as physically-sound data-driven representations of such systems. Viewing Runge-Kutta methods as graphical models, we consider a residual {NN} architecture and introduce bilinear layers to embed non-linearities which are intrinsic features of geophysical systems. From numerical experiments for synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the relevance of the proposed {NN}-based architecture both in terms of forecasting performance and model identification.},

	abstract = {To understand and predict large, complex, and chaotic systems, Earth scientists build simulators from physical laws. Simulators generalize better to new scenarios, require fewer tunable parameters, and are more interpretable than nonphysical deep learning, but procedures for obtaining their derivatives with respect to their inputs are often unavailable. These missing derivatives limit the application of many important tools for forecasting, model tuning, sensitivity analysis, or subgrid-scale parametrization. Here, we propose to overcome this limitation with deep emulator networks that learn to calculate the missing derivatives. By training directly on simulation data without analyzing source code or equations, this approach supports simulators in any programming language on any hardware without specialized routines for each case. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we train emulators on complete or partial system states of the chaotic Lorenz-96 simulator and evaluate the accuracy of their dynamics and derivatives as a function of integration time and training data set size. We further demonstrate that emulator-derived derivatives enable accurate 4D-Var data assimilation and closed-loop training of parametrizations. These results provide a basis for further combining the parsimony and generality of physical models with the power and flexibility of machine learning.},

This work focuses on monthly and annual components of the water budget over 12 National Weather Service ({NWS}) River Forecast Centers ({RFCs}). Monthly gridded {FLUX} Network ({FLUXNET}) evapotranspiration ({ET}) from the Max-Planck Institute ({MPI}) of Germany, U.S. Geological Survey ({USGS}) total runoff (Q), changes in total water storage ({dS}/dt, derived as a residual by utilizing {MPI} {ET} and {USGS} Q in the water balance equation), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ({GRACE}) observed total water storage anomaly ({TWSA}) and change ({TWSC}) are used as reference data sets. Compared to these {ET} and Q benchmarks, Mosaic and {SAC} (Noah and {VIC}) in the operational {NLDAS}-2 overestimate (underestimate) mean annual reference {ET} and underestimate (overestimate) mean annual reference Q. The multimodel ensemble mean ({MME}) is closer to the mean annual reference {ET} and Q. An anomaly correlation ({AC}) analysis shows good {AC} values for simulated monthly mean Q and {dS}/dt but signiﬁcantly smaller {AC} values for simulated {ET}. Upgraded versions of the models utilized in the research side of {NLDAS}-2 yield largely improved performance in the simulation of these mean annual and monthly water component diagnostics. These results demonstrate that the three intertwined efforts of improving (1) the scientiﬁc understanding of parameterization of land surface processes, (2) the spatial and temporal extent of systematic validation of land surface processes, and (3) the engineering-oriented aspects such as parameter calibration and optimization are key to substantially improving product quality in various land data assimilation systems.},

We have recently coupled the sophisticated {NCAR} Community Land Model version 3 ({CLM}3) into {WRF} to better characterize land surface processes. Among these four land surface schemes, the {STD} scheme is the simplest in both structure and process physics. The Noah and {RUC} schemes are at the intermediate level of complexity. {CLM}3 includes the most sophisticated snow, soil, and vegetation physics among these land surface schemes. {WRF} simulations with all four land surface schemes over the western United States ({WUS}) were carried out for the 1 October 1995 through 30 September 1996. The results show that land surface processes strongly affect temperature simulations over the ({WUS}). As compared to observations, {WRF}-{CLM}3 with the highest complexity level significantly improves temperature simulations, except for the wintertime maximum temperature. Precipitation is dramatically overestimated by {WRF} with all four land surface schemes over the ({WUS}) analyzed in this study and does not show a close relationship with land surface processes.},

	abstract = {Introduction The {NASA} {SPoRT} Program has been producing a real-time instance of {NASA}’s Land Information System (hereafter {SPoRT}-{LIS}) since {\textasciitilde}2010, which contains output of soil moisture and temperature at layered depths, as well as layers of soil moisture percentiles and snow water equivalent. The unique configuration of the {SPoRT}-{LIS} enables decision-making on operational timescales since it incorporates near realtime operational observations such as the daily {NOAA}/{NESDIS} {VIIRS} Green Vegetation Fraction and the combined radar+gauge Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor ({MRMS}) {QPE}. The {SPoRT}-{LIS} was developed initially to provide land surface initialization variables for local numerical weather prediction models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting ({WRF}) model. The earliest documented uses of the {SPoRT}-{LIS} as a tool for local drought analysis came from the {NWS} forecast office in Huntsville, {AL} in 2011, in which data were used to provide recommendations for drought category changes to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Through engagement with {SPoRT} collaborative partners, the {SPoRT}-{LIS} gradually expanded in recent years as a component of drought analysis to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Other applications over the years have included using {SPoRT}-{LIS} in qualitative pluvial analyses, assessing land surface conditions leading to wildfires, and use by State Climatologist offices. This poster provides examples of applying the {SPoRT}-{LIS} for drought analysis, fire weather, and pluvial / flood assessments, which served to motivate the development of machine learning applications (see Andrew White presentation).},

	abstract = {The second version of the {NCEP} Climate Forecast System ({CFSv}2) was made operational at {NCEP} in March 2011. This version has upgrades to nearly all aspects of the data assimilation and forecast model components of the system. A coupled reanalysis was made over a 32-yr period (1979–2010), which provided the initial conditions to carry out a comprehensive reforecast over 29 years (1982–2010). This was done to obtain consistent and stable calibrations, as well as skill estimates for the operational subseasonal and seasonal predictions at {NCEP} with {CFSv}2. The operational implementation of the full system ensures a continuity of the climate record and provides a valuable up-to-date dataset to study many aspects of predictability on the seasonal and subseasonal scales. Evaluation of the reforecasts show that the {CFSv}2 increases the length of skillful {MJO} forecasts from 6 to 17 days (dramatically improving subseasonal forecasts), nearly doubles the skill of seasonal forecasts of 2-m temperatures over the United States, and significantly improves global {SST} forecasts over its predecessor. The {CFSv}2 not only provides greatly improved guidance at these time scales but also creates many more products for subseasonal and seasonal forecasting with an extensive set of retrospective forecasts for users to calibrate their forecast products. These retrospective and real-time operational forecasts will be used by a wide community of users in their decision making processes in areas such as water management for rivers and agriculture, transportation, energy use by utilities, wind and other sustainable energy, and seasonal prediction of the hurricane season.},

This review summarises a growing body of evidence indicating that greater use of in situ, remotely sensed, and modelled soil moisture information in fire danger rating systems could lead to better estimates of dynamic live and dead herbaceous fuel loads, more accurate live and dead fuel moisture predictions, earlier warning of wildfire danger, and better forecasts of wildfire occurrence and size. Potential uses of soil moisture information in existing wildfire danger rating systems include (1) as a supplement or replacement for drought indices, (2) for live and (3) dead fuel moisture modelling, (4) for estimating herbaceous fuel curing, and (5) for estimating fuel loads. We identify key remaining research questions and note the logistical challenge of convincing wildfire professionals of the importance of soil moisture compared with more familiar wildfire danger metrics. While obstacles remain, the path forward is clear. Soil moisture information can and should be used to improve fire danger rating systems and contribute to more effective fire management for the protection of communities and ecosystems worldwide.},

	abstract = {Dead fuel moisture influences the risk of fire ignition events, with implications for fire hazards, risk mitigation, and the design of prescribed burning activities. Because direct fuel moisture measurements are rarely available, fuel moisture must be estimated when evaluating fire risks. Most estimates rely primarily on atmospheric conditions and ignore the interaction of fuels with the soil surface with which they are in hydraulic contact. In this study we explore whether dead fuel moisture predictions can be improved with information about surface soil moisture. Despite the likelihood that dead fuels would exchange water with underlying soil, the influence of soil moisture on fuel moisture has been poorly studied. An analysis of 202 observations of co-located soil moisture, 1 and 10 h fuel moisture measurements, with environmental and meteorological covariates, showed that soil moisture had a small but significant effect on fuel moisture across all sampled conditions. The influence of soil moisture on fuel moisture was the most important among all other environmental factors for wet soil conditions and 10-h fuels, where a 1\% increase in soil moisture content led to approximately a 0.6\% increase in fuel moisture. The effect of soil moisture on 1-h fuel moisture although significant was small. Incorporating spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture into time-series or spatial predictions of fuel moisture tended to (i) reduce the seasonal duration in which fuels had a high probability of ignition by an average of 52–60 days across the tested years, and (ii) increased the heterogeneity of the probability of ignition through space, compared with similar models that did not incorporate soil moisture information.},

Standardized anomalies from the remote sensing based Evaporative Stress Index ({ESI}) and Vegetation Drought Response Index ({VegDRI}) and soil moisture anomalies from the North American Land Data Assimilation System ({NLDAS}) are compared to the United States Drought Monitor ({USDM}), surface meteorological conditions, and crop and soil moisture data compiled by the National Agricultural Statistics Service ({NASS}). Overall, the results show that rapid decreases in the {ESI} and {NLDAS} anomalies often preceded drought intensification in the {USDM} by up to 6wk depending on the region. Decreases in the {ESI} tended to occur up to several weeks before deteriorations were observed in the crop condition datasets. The {NLDAS} soil moisture anomalies were similar to those depicted in the {NASS} soil moisture datasets; however, some differences were noted in how each model responded to the changing drought conditions. The {VegDRI} anomalies tracked the evolution of the {USDM} drought depiction in regions with slow drought development, but lagged the {USDM} and other drought indicators when conditions were changing rapidly. Comparison to the crop condition datasets revealed that soybean conditions were most similar to {ESI} anomalies computed over short time periods (2–4wk), whereas corn conditions were more closely related to longer-range (8–12wk) {ESI} anomalies. Crop yield departures were consistent with the drought severity depicted by the {ESI} and to a lesser extent by the {NLDAS} and {VegDRI} datasets.},

We will mine these datasets associated with lightning-caused (and null) events to determine important relationships, distributions, and delineators that correspond to elevated threat areas for lightning-initiated wildfires.},

This map will be included as an at-launch product of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}) to serve as an input for several algorithms requiring knowledge of land cover type. The methodology was derived from a similar effort to create a product at 8 km spatial resolution, where high resolution data sets were interpreted in order to derive a coarse-resolution training data set. A set of 37 294 x 1 km pixels was used within a hierarchical tree structure to classify the {AVHRR} data into 12 classes. The approach taken involved a hierarchy of pair-wise class trees where a logic based on vegetation form was applied until all classes were depicted. Multitemporal {AVHRR} metrics were used to predict class memberships. Minimum annual red reflectance, peak annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}), and minimum channel three brightness temperature were among the most used metrics. Depictions of forests and woodlands, and areas of mechanized agriculture are in general agreement with other sources of information, while classes such as low biomass agriculture and high-latitude broadleaf forest are not. Comparisons of the final product with regional digital land cover maps derived from high-resolution remotely sensed data reveal general agreement, except for apparently poor depictions of temperate pastures within areas of agriculture. Distinguishing between forest and non-forest was achieved with agreements ranging from 81 to 92\% for these regional subsets. The agreements for all classes varied from an average of 65\% when viewing all pixels to an average of 82\% when viewing only those 1 km pixels consisting of greater than 90\% one class within the high-resolution data sets.},

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the {COCO} object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to {ILSVRC} \& {COCO} 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of {ImageNet} detection, {ImageNet} localization, {COCO} detection, and {COCO} segmentation.},

	abstract = {The Noah model is a land surface model of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. It has been widely used in regional coupled weather and climate models (i.e. Weather Research and Forecasting Model, Eta Mesoscale Model) and global coupled weather and climate models (i.e. National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System, Climate Forecast System). Therefore, its continued improvement and development are keys to enhancing our weather and climate forecast ability and water and energy flux simulation accuracy. North American Land Data Assimilation System phase 1 ({NLDAS}-1) experiments indicated that the Noah model exhibited substantial bias in latent heat flux, total runoff and land skin temperature during the warm season, and such bias can significantly affect coupled weather and climate models. This paper presents a study to improve the Noah model by adding model parameterization processes such as including seasonal factor on leaf area index and root distribution and selecting optimal model parameters. We compared simulated latent heat flux, mean annual runoff and land skin temperature from the Noah control and test versions with measured latent heat flux, land surface skin temperature, mean annual runoff and satellite-retrieved land surface skin temperature. The results show that the test version significantly reduces biases in latent heat, total runoff and land skin temperature simulation. The test version has been used for the {NLDAS} phase 2 ({NLDAS}-2) to produce 30-year water flux, energy flux and state variable products to support the {US} drought monitor of National Integrated Drought Information System.

These three submodels were detached from {SiB} and used on the {SiB} parameter set (total and green leaf area index, leaf angle orientation, canopy dimensions, etc.) to calculate global monthly fields of albedo, roughness length and minimum stomatal resistance at 1° × 1° resolution. Time series of various parameters are also displayed for each vegetation type for specified grid points. The {SiB} results compare reasonably well with appropriate measurements obtained from the literature and have the additional merit of being mutually consistent; the three submodels use many common parameters, which ensures that, for each grid area, the calculated surface properties are closely interrelated as is the case in nature. The derived fields provide a check on the operation of the submodels and the correctness of the parameter set.

This study explores the potential of deriving these two variables from the {NOAA} Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ({AVHRR}) normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) data. Obviously, one {NDVI} measurement does not allow simultaneous derivation of both vegetation variables. Simple models of a satellite pixel are used to illustrate the ambiguity resulting from a combination of the unknown horizontal (fg) and vertical (Lg) densities. We argue that for {NOAA} {AVHRR} data sets based on observations with a spatial resolution of a few kilometres the most appropriate way to resolve this ambiguity is to assume that the vegetated part of a pixel is covered by dense vegetation (i.e., its leaf area index is high), and to calculate fg=({NDVI}-{NDVI}0)/({NDVI}8-{NDVI}0), where {NDVIo} (bare soil) and {NDVI} (dense vegetation) are specified as global constants independent of vegetation/soil type. Global (0.15o)2 spatial resolution monthly maps of fg were produced from a 5-year {NDVI} climatology and incorporated in the {NWS} models. As a result, the model surface fluxes were improved.},

	abstract = {A generalization of the single soil layer variable infiltration capacity ({VIC}) land surface hydrological model previously implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory general circulation model ({GCM}) is described. The new model is comprised of a two-layer characterization of the soil column, and uses an aerodynamic representation of the latent and sensible heat fluxes at the land surface. The infiltration algorithm for the upper layer is essentially the same as for the single layer {VIC} model, while the lower layer drainage formulation is of the form previously implemented in the Max-Planck-Institut {GCM}. The model partitions the area of interest (e.g., grid cell) into multiple land surface cover types; for each land cover type the fraction of roots in the upper and lower zone is specified. Evapotranspiration consists of three components: canopy evaporation, evaporation from bare soils, and transpiration, which is represented using a canopy and architectural resistance formulation. Once the latent heat flux has been computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to solve for the land surface temperature at each time step. The model was tested using long-term hydrologic and climatological data for Kings Creek, Kansas to estimate and validate the hydrological parameters, and surface flux data from three First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment intensive field campaigns in the summer-fall of 1987 to validate the surface energy fluxes.},

The influence of afternoon instability increases the aerodynamic term of the modified Penman relationship by 50\% or more on days with moderate instability. However, the unmodified Penman relationship predicts values of daily potential evaporation close to that of the stability-dependent relationship. This agreement is partly due to compensating overestimation during nighttime hours. Errors due to use of daily-averaged variables are examined in detail by evaluating the nonlinear interactions between the diurnal variation of the variables in the Penman relationship. A simpler method for estimating the exchange coefficient is constructed from an empirical relationship between the radiation Richardson number and the Obukhov length. This method is less accurate, but it allows estimation of the stability-dependent exchange coefficient using only parameters already required for evaluation of the Penman relationship. Finally, the diurnal variation of the atmospheric resistance coefficient appearing in the Penman-Monteith relationship is presented.},

In {NLDAS}, the Noah, Variable Infiltration Capacity, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting, and Mosaic land surface models ({LSMs}) are executed over the conterminous U.S. ({CONUS}) in realtime and retrospective modes. These runs support the drought analysis, monitoring and forecasting activities of the National Integrated Drought Information System, as well as efforts to monitor large-scale floods. {NLDAS}-2 builds upon the framework of the first phase of {NLDAS} ({NLDAS}-1) by increasing the accuracy and consistency of the surface forcing data, upgrading the land surface model code and parameters, and extending the study from a 3-year (1997–1999) to a 30-year (1979–2008) time window. As the first of two parts, this paper details the configuration of {NLDAS}-2, describes the upgrades to the forcing, parameters, and code of the four {LSMs}, and explores overall model-to-model comparisons of land surface water and energy flux and state variables over the {CONUS}. Focusing on model output rather than on observations, this study seeks to highlight the similarities and differences between models, and to assess changes in output from that seen in {NLDAS}-1. The second part of the two-part article focuses on the validation of model-simulated streamflow and evaporation against observations. The results depict a higher level of agreement among the four models over much of the {CONUS} than was found in the first phase of {NLDAS}. This is due, in part, to recent improvements in the parameters, code, and forcing of the {NLDAS}-2 {LSMs} that were initiated following {NLDAS}-1. However, large inter-model differences still exist in the northeast, Lake Superior, and western mountainous regions of the {CONUS}, which are associated with cold season processes. In addition, variations in the representation of sub-surface hydrology in the four {LSMs} lead to large differences in modeled evaporation and subsurface runoff. These issues are important targets for future research by the land surface modeling community. Finally, improvement from {NLDAS}-1 to {NLDAS}-2 is summarized by comparing the streamflow measured from U.S. Geological Survey stream gauges with that simulated by four {NLDAS} models over 961 small basins.},

The first part concentrates on a model-by-model comparison of mean annual and monthly water fluxes, energy fluxes and state variables. In this second part, the focus is on the validation of simulated streamflow from four land surface models (Noah, Mosaic, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting ({SAC}-{SMA}), and Variable Infiltration Capacity ({VIC}) models) and their ensemble mean. Comparisons are made against 28-years (1 October 1979–30 September 2007) of United States Geological Survey observed streamflow for 961 small basins and 8 major basins over the conterminous United States ({CONUS}). Relative bias, anomaly correlation and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency ({NSE}) statistics at daily to annual time scales are used to assess model-simulated streamflow. The Noah (the Mosaic) model overestimates (underestimates) mean annual runoff and underestimates (overestimates) mean annual evapotranspiration. The {SAC}-{SMA} and {VIC} models simulate the mean annual runoff and evapotranspiration well when compared with the observations. The ensemble mean is closer to the mean annual observed streamflow for both the 961 small basins and the 8 major basins than is the mean from any individual model. All of the models, as well as the ensemble mean, have large daily, weekly, monthly, and annual streamflow anomaly correlations for most basins over the {CONUS}, implying strong simulation skill. However, the daily, weekly, and monthly {NSE} analysis results are not necessarily encouraging, in particular for daily streamflow. The Noah and Mosaic models are useful ({NSE} {\textgreater} 0.4) only for about 10\% of the 961 small basins, the {SAC}-{SMA} and {VIC} models are useful for about 30\% of the 961 small basins, and the ensemble mean is useful for about 42\% of the 961 small basins. As the time scale increases, the {NSE} increases as expected. However, even for monthly streamflow, the ensemble mean is useful for only 75\% of the 961 small basins.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called {BERT}, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), {BERT} is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained {BERT} model can be ﬁnetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.},

The differences inthese three schemes and the resulting surface exchange coefficients do not, in general, lead to significant differences in model simulated surface fluxes, skin temperature, andprecipitation, provided the same treatment of roughness length for heat is employed.Rather, the model is more sensitive to the choice of the roughness length for heat. To assess the latter, we also tested two approaches to specifythe roughness length for heat: 1) assuming the roughness length for heat is a fixed ratio of the roughness length for momentum, and 2) relating this ratio to the roughness Reynolds number as proposed by Zilitinkevich.Our 1-D column model sensitivity tests suggested that the Zilitinkevich approach can improve the surface heat fluxand skin temperature simulations. A long-term test with the {NCEP} {mesoscaleEta} model indicated that this approach can also reduce forecast precipitation bias. Based on these simulations, in January 1996 we operationally implemented the Paulsonscheme with the new land-surface scheme of the {NCEP} Eta model, along with the Zilitinkevich formulation to specify the roughness length for heat.[{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

	abstract = {Attempts to correlate values of stomatal conductance and leaf water potential with particular environmental variables in the field are generally of only limited success because they are simultaneously affected by a number of environmental variables. For example, correlations between leaf water potential and either flux of radiant energy or vapour pressure deficit show a diurnal hysteresis which leads to a scatter diagram if many values are plotted. However, a simple model may be adequate to relate leaf water potential to the flow of water through the plant. The stomatal conductance of illuminated leaves is a function of current levels of temperature, vapour pressure deficit, leaf water potential (really turgor pressure) and ambient {CO}2 concentration. Consequently, when plotted against any one of these variables a scatter diagram results. Physiological knowledge of stomatal functioning is not adequate to provide a mechanistic model linking stomatal conductance to all these variables. None the less, the parameters describing the relationships with the variables can be conveniently estimated from field data by a technique of non-linear least squares, for predictive purposes and to describe variations in response from season to season and plant to plant.},

	abstract = {A parametric water balance model was developed based on statistical averaging of the main hydrological processes. The model has a two-layer structure with both a physical and statistical basis for the model parameters. It was developed to fill a need for models with a small number of parameters and of intermediate complexity between a one-parameter simple bucket and more complex hydrologically oriented models with many parameters such as the Sacramento model. The focus was to improve the representation of runoff relative to the simple bucket without introducing the full complexity of the Sacramento model. The model was designed to operate over a range of time steps to facilitate coupling to an atmospheric model. The model can be used for catchment scale simulations in hydrological applications and for simple representation of runoff in coupled atmospheric/hydrological models. An important role for the simple water balance ({SWB}) model is to assist in understanding how much complexity in representing land surface processes is needed and can be supported with available data to estimate model parameters. The model is tested using rainfall, runoff, and surface meteorological data for three catchments from different climate regimes. Model performance is compared to performance of a simple bucket model, the Sacramento model, and the Oregon State University land surface model. Finally, a series of tests were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of {SWB} performance when it is operated at time steps different from the time step for which it was calibrated.},

	abstract = {Abstract Data from the 1987 summer {FIFE} experiment for four pairs of days are compared with corresponding 48-h forecasts from two different versions of the Eta Model, both initialized from the {NCEP}–{NCAR} (National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research) global reanalysis. One used the late 1995 operational Eta Model physics, the second, with a new soil and land surface scheme and revisions to the surface layer and boundary layer schemes, used the physics package that became operational on 31 January 1996. Improvements in the land surface parameterization and its interaction with the atmosphere are one key to improved summer precipitation forecasts. The new soil thermal model is an improvement over the earlier slab soil model, although the new skin temperature generally now has too large a diurnal cycle (whereas the old surface temperature had too small a diurnal cycle) and is more sensitive to net radiation errors. The nighttime temperature minima are often too low, because of a model underestimate of the downwelling radiation, despite improvements in the coupling of the surface and boundary layer at night. The daytime incoming solar radiation has a substantial high bias in both models, because of some coding errors (which have now been corrected), insufficient atmospheric shortwave absorption, and underestimates of cloud. The authors explore evaporation before and after a midsummer heavy rain event with the two models. The late 1995 operational model uses a soil moisture bucket physics, with a specified annual-mean fixed field soil moisture climatology, so the surface evaporation responds primarily to the atmospheric forcing. While the surface fluxes in the new model show this strong rain event more dramatically, because its soil moisture comes from the global reanalysis rather than climatology, there remain problems with soil moisture initialization. It appears that a fully continuous Eta data assimilation system (which is under development), likely with more than two soil layers and assimilation of observed hourly precipitation, will be needed to get an adequate soil moisture initialization. Evaporation in the new two-layer soil model falls too much from forecast day 1 to day 2, as the first shallow 10-cm layer dries out (as it also does in the 1995 model with the bucket physics). This appears to be related to the specified low vegetation fraction and the bare soil evaporation model. Although the new boundary layer scheme is better coupled to the surface at night, both versions underestimate entrainment at the top of the mixed layer. The improvement in the surface evaporation resulting from using a climatological green vegetation fraction (derived from satellite data) and a revised bare soil evaporation formulation are shown. These changes were incorporated in a model physics revision in February 1997. An encouraging result from one case study, when it rained in the model, shows that the interaction between the surface, boundary layer, and convection schemes during precipitation is satisfactory, although the model underestimates the impact of cloud cover on the incoming solar radiation.},

Predictive relationships describing the hydraulic parameter distributions must be developed based on the common descriptors of the physical properties of soils (e.g., texture, structure, particle size distribution). Covariation among the hydraulic parameters within these relationships must be identified. Data for 1448 soil samples were examined in an evaluation of the usefulness of qualitative descriptors as predictors of soil hydraulic behavior. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression techniques were used to derive quantitative expressions for the moments of the hydraulic parameters as functions of the particle size distributions (percent sand, silt, and clay content) of soils. Discriminant analysis suggests that the covariation of the hydraulic parameters can be used to construct a classification scheme based on the hydraulic behavior of soils that is analogous to the textural classification scheme based on the sand, silt, and clay content of soils.},

An original model assumption that there is no significant heat transfer during redistribution of liquid water was relaxed by including a source/sink term in the heat transfer equation to account for latent heat during phase transitions of soil moisture. The parameterization uses the layer-integrated form of heat and water diffusion equations adopted by the original Eta-{LSS}. Therefore it simulates the total ice content of each selected soil layer. Infiltration reduction under frozen ground conditions was estimated by probabilistic averaging of spatially variable ice content of the soil profile. Off-line uncoupled tests of the new and original Eta-{LSS} were performed using experimental data from Rosemount, Minnesota. Simulated soil temperature and unfrozen water content matched observed data reasonably well. Neglecting frozen ground processes leads to significant underestimation/overestimation of soil temperature during soil freezing/thawing periods and underestimates total soil moisture content after extensive periods of soil freezing.},

The initiative is largely sponsored by the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment ({GEWEX}) Continental-Scale International Project ({GCIP}). As the overview for nine {NLDAS} papers, this paper describes and evaluates the 3-year {NLDAS} execution of 1 October 1996 to 30 September 1999, a period rich in observations for validation. The validation emphasizes (1) the land states, fluxes, and input forcing of four land models, (2) the application of new {GCIP}-sponsored products, and (3) a multiscale approach. The validation includes (1) mesoscale observing networks of land surface forcing, fluxes, and states, (2) regional snowpack measurements, (3) daily streamflow measurements, and (4) satellite-based retrievals of snow cover, land surface skin temperature ({LST}), and surface insolation. The results show substantial intermodel differences in surface evaporation and runoff (especially over nonsparse vegetation), soil moisture storage, snowpack, and {LST}. Owing to surprisingly large intermodel differences in aerodynamic conductance, intermodel differences in midday summer {LST} were unlike those expected from the intermodel differences in Bowen ratio. Last, anticipating future assimilation of {LST}, an {NLDAS} effort unique to this overview paper assesses geostationary-satellite-derived {LST}, determines the latter to be of good quality, and applies the latter to validate modeled {LST}.},

This approach proved to be very beneficial to understanding the performance and limitations of different land surface models. These four surface models, embodying different complexities of the evaporation/hydrology treatment, included the traditional simple bucket model, the simple water balance ({SWB}) model, the Oregon State University ({OSU}) model, and the simplified Simple Biosphere ({SSiB}) model. The bucket model overestimated the evaporation during wet periods, and this resulted in unrealistically large negative sensible heat fluxes. The {SWB} model, despite its simple evaporation formulation, simulated well the evaporation during wet periods, but it tended to underestimate the evaporation during dry periods. Overall, the {OSU} model ably simulated the observed seasonal and diurnal variation in evaporation, soil moisture, sensible heat flux, and surface skin temperature. The more complex {SSiB} model performed similarly to the {OSU} model. A range of sensitivity experiments showed that some complexity in the canopy resistance scheme is important in reducing both the overestimation of evaporation during wet periods and underestimation during dry periods. Properly parameterizing not only the effect of soil moisture stress but also other canopy resistance factors, such as the vapor pressure deficit stress, is critical for canopy resistance evaluation. An overly simple canopy resistance that includes only soil moisture stress is unable to simulate observed surface evaporation during dry periods. Given a modestly comprehensive time-dependent canopy resistance treatment, a rather simple surface model such as the {OSU} model can provide good area-averaged surface heat fluxes for mesoscale atmospheric models.},

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations.

We use warm season, high-frequency, near-surface states and turbulent fluxes collected over nine sites in the U.S. Southern Great Plains. We quantify changes in the pattern of sensitive parameters, the amount and nature of the interaction between parameters, and the covariance structure of the distribution of behavioral parameter sets. Using Sobol′'s total and first-order sensitivity indexes, we show that few parameters directly control the variance of the model response. Significant parameter interaction occurs. Optimal parameter values differ between models, and the relationships between parameters also change. {GW} decreases unwarranted parameter interaction and appears to improve model realism, especially at wetter study sites. {DV} increases parameter interaction and decreases identifiability, implying it is overparameterized and/or underconstrained. At a wet site, {GW} has two functional modes: one that mimics {STD} and a second in which {GW} improves model function by decoupling direct evaporation and base flow. Unsupervised classification of the posterior distributions of behavioral parameter sets cannot group similar sites based solely on soil or vegetation type, helping to explain why transferability between sites and models is not straightforward.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2205.13504},
	abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of Transformer-based solutions for the long-term time series forecasting ({LTSF}) task. Despite the growing performance over the past few years, we question the validity of this line of research in this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among the elements in a long sequence. However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in an ordered set of continuous points. While employing positional encoding and using tokens to embed sub-series in Transformers facilitate preserving some ordering information, the nature of the {\textbackslash}emph\{permutation-invariant\} self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss. To validate our claim, we introduce a set of embarrassingly simple one-layer linear models named {LTSF}-Linear for comparison. Experimental results on nine real-life datasets show that {LTSF}-Linear surprisingly outperforms existing sophisticated Transformer-based {LTSF} models in all cases, and often by a large margin. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to explore the impacts of various design elements of {LTSF} models on their temporal relation extraction capability. We hope this surprising finding opens up new research directions for the {LTSF} task. We also advocate revisiting the validity of Transformer-based solutions for other time series analysis tasks (e.g., anomaly detection) in the future.

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},
