\section{Exploratory Model Runs}

As mentioned in the previous chapter, one of the main challenges encountered while training neural networks is the overwhelming number of independent variables that can affect model performance. These so-called ``hyperparameters'' may have complex interdependence, and there are few general best-practices. In order to identify a reasonable baseline for the performance of each of the model architectures, we started by training a wide variety of permutations on model properties including the number of layers, nodes per layer, activation function, and prediction coarseness, as well as training properties including loss function characteristics, batch normalization, and weight dropout rate. At this stage, developing a rigorous understanding of the effects of changes in model and training setup was not a priority; instead, we modified multiple hyperparameters simultaneously between training iterations with the goal of establishing rough rules of thumb and a sense for the approximate size of models needed for this task.

All of the bulk statistics in this section are reported in terms of relative soil moisture. The bar charts of correlation coefficient, mean absolute error, and mean squared error separately display the error in hourly increment change and integrated soil state, while the entropy-based metrics (uncertainty contribution and fractional information) are calculated only for the increment change. Tables include metrics for each of the depth levels from top to bottom: 0-10cm, 10-40cm, and 40-100cm.

The validation loss of each of the ANN variants generally stopped decreasing after about 18 hours of training on a CPU, though the training time of individual models unsurprisingly depended most strongly on the size of the model and the learning rate parameters. The models shown here have a number of trainable parameters on the order of 100,000. The best-performing instances of the simplest architecture variant (accfnn-rsm-8) had only about 31,000 parameters and used mean absolute error as the base loss function. The FNN instances struggled to converge any time dropout was used during training, and the predictive skill of best model seemed to improve in the lower two layers in response to a loss function manipulation that ignored prediction cost associated with timesteps where the true magnitude of change in soil moisture state was close to zero. Furthermore, the best FNN did not consider error in state within the loss function (increment loss ratio $\rho = 1$), but was trained with a considerable increment magnitude bias of $\gamma = 60$. The network consisted of 8 fully-connected layers each with 64 nodes.

Next, we present a variety of LSTM instances that predict the increment change in volumetric soil moisture (VSM; $\frac{kg}{m^2}$), which we will refer to as the LSTM-VSM group. The results reported here have been converted to relative soil moisture after-the-fact for consistency with the other architectures. In practice, these were the first generations of models we tested; those which appear in Table \ref{model-init-lstm-table-1} were trained using a consistent learning rate and converged rapidly to fairly poor results. Even relatively large models with a variety of hyperparameter configurations didn't achieve a correlation coefficient higher than .65 for any of the layers. Introducing the log-cyclical learning rate schedule prolonged training and, combined with the loss function modifications, resulted in considerably better-performing LSTMs. Given its apparent success, we continued to use the log-cyclical learning rate strategy for the remainder of the models, changing only the rate of decay and the initial minima and maxima of the oscillations. The best LSTM-VSM models we trained had 77,117 trainable weights, a magnitude bias parameter of $\gamma = 10$, increment loss ratio $\rho = .999$, and did not use increment normalization within the loss function. Unlike the FNN architectures, the best LSTM-VSM variants tended to include a small weight dropout of 5\% during training, however without further analysis it is difficult to draw conclusions on the actual impact of any of these changes in isolation.

The next group of models we trained will be referred to as LSTM-RSM models, which have the same structure as the previous set, but target the increment change in RSM rather than volumetric soil moisture. Like the LSTM-VSM models, these seemed to show diminishing returns with model sizes beyond 100,000 weights. The best model we identified has only 48,667 trainable weights, and is 4 layers in depth. Curiously, while the loss function manipulations appeared to have a positive impact on the FNN and LSTM-VSM variants, LSTM-RSM models generally underperformed when a higher magnitude bias and a stronger contribution from the state were used. The best model had a relatively small increment magnitude bias $\gamma=10$, and no contribution from state error ($\rho=1$).

\section{Best Models' Bulk Statistics Comparison}

As Table \ref{model-init-best-table} and Figure \ref{best-metrics} display, the best LSTM-RSM model performed better than the other categories at all of the depth levels, and for each of the evaluation metrics, followed by the LSTM-VSM, and finally the FNN architecture. During evaluation on the full 2018-2023 test dataset, we recorded the execution speed of each of the models as they were applied to multiple subdomains with varying numbers of valid pixels, then fitted a linear regression to the relationship between subdomain size and the time it took to generate a 2-week prediction for each pixel. Evaluation was done with a single CPU thread on a shared high-performance computing cluster. The results in Table \ref{best-exec-efficiency-table} indicate that the initial spin-up time of each model is between 3 and 4 seconds, and execution time for each subsequent pixel is between .1 and 1 millisecond, and is directly proportional to the number of trainable weights in each of the models. When applied to the full domain of 50,875 pixels, the FNN was by far the fastest model at only around 9.5 seconds, while the LSTM variants clocked in at a bit over 40 seconds.

\end{figure}

The highest error rates in terms of RSM for each of were associated with the 0-10cm surface layer, which is unsurprising considering that a larger number of processes within Noah-LSM affect the soil dynamics within the topmost layer, which is uniquely influenced by bare-surface evaporation and infiltration from rain and canopy percolation. Furthermore, since the soil layers increase in thickness within Noah-LSM from 10cm at the surface layer to 30cm and 60cm for the deeper layers, each kilogram of actual water mass corresponds to a smaller increment of RSM as it drains downward.

Figure \ref{best-horizons} shows the mean absolute error in RSM for each of the best models with respect to the forecst horizon distance in hours from initialization time. One surprising result that appears universal among the models we trained is that the first few prediction steps consistently have the highest average error in the increment change. For the LSTMs, this could be an indication that the 24 hour spin-up encoder used to initialize the RNN latent vectors prior to the first prediction step have room for improvement, however the FNN has no such encoder. The cause of this spike in error is presently unclear, however in practice, this issue could be mitigated by initializing prediction a few hours prior to the actual initial unknown forecast step, and discarding the first troublesome predictions of increment change.

Figures \ref{grid-full_rsm-10}, \ref{grid-full_rsm-40}, and \ref{grid-full_rsm-100} show the overall spatial distribution of mean absolute error and model bias at the 0-10cm, 10-40cm, and 40-100cm depth levels, respectively. We will use the information that these graphics provide to identify areas of anomalous model behavior for further investigation in the following section.

The LSTM-RSM shows a widespread slight dry bias in the surface layer with the exception of urban areas, mountainous regions, and some sandy areas in Texas, New Mexico, and the Northern Midwest. The LSTM-VSM (lstm-20) largely follows suit, though it also showed regions of wet bias where the LSTM-RSM was more neutral or dry including silty regions corresponding to the Ouachita mountains, central Kentucky and the Cumberland plateu, the Northern Rockies in Idaho and Montana, and Florida. The FNN model had significantly more of a wet bias in the surface layer for some regions, which are largely discretely distinguishable by their soil texture boundaries.

All three models had more of a mixture of wet and dry biases in the 10-40cm layer. In the Midwest, Northern Wisconson and Minnesota were dry except for isolated sandy pixels, while the cropland in the Ohio and Missouri River basins to the South and West of that region were notably too wet: a pattern that was further emphasized in the 40-100cm layer. The wet bias associated with the cropland surface type was also apparent in Mississippi Alluvial Plains of Eastern Arkansas and the Missouri Bootheel, discrete regions of East Texas, the Florida Penninsula, and East-central South Carolina. Furthermore, each of the models also demonstrated a wet bias associated with clay-dominant pixels in the Centeral Texas and surrounding the Southern extent of the Mississippi River. In addition to the Northeast and Northern Midwest, the regions with the most significant dry bias in the lower two layers seemed to be associated with higher elevation, especially the Sierra Nevada mountains, Colorado Rockies, and Central Idaho, although the Cascades seem to be an exception with a stark wet bias for the LSTM-RSM model.

\end{table}

In the lower two layers, there is also an anomalous tiling artifact present in the model biases that is especially noticable in the Ohio river valley, Montana, and the central Great Plains. The emerging squares are 8 pixels in length and width, forming a $1^\circ$ grid. This was initially perplexing since no similar pattern appears in the forcings, however close inspection of the mean Noah-LSM soil moisture content in 40-100cm layer of Figure \ref{gs-rsm} also reveals subtle edges that align with the tiles in observed in the model bias. Upon further investigation, we found that the square boundaries are spatially associated with an input parameter in Noah-LSM called SLOPETYPE which controls the rate at which water drains out of the lowest layer of the model by applying one of 9 discrete classes \parencite{mitchell_community_2005}, which are displayed and tabulated in Figure \ref{slopetype-classes} and Table \ref{slopetype-classes-table}. Although the indeces map to categories describing the mixture of surface slopes in the model, this parameter is distinct from the $0.125^\circ$ surface slope used for the snowpack parameterization, and wasn't provided as an input to the ANNs during training. Each category is also assigned a drainage rate, such that the regions in the Ohio Valley with a dry bias in the ANN results have slow bottom-layer drainage efficiency, and inversely the wet-biased regions correspond to fast drainage. This is a fairly conclusive indication that the patterns in model bias are emergent from the unexplained variance introduced by leaving out these values.

Despite the inconsistencies between the models' biases, several regions stand out as especially troublesome in terms of all of the models' mean absolute error. Sandy areas in the Midwest, Nebraska, Oregon, and the Four Corners region of the Desert Southwest have high error rates in the first two layers. In the 40-100cm layer, clay pixels in Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and Northern Ohio suffer, and the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountains proved especially difficult for the models to characterize in the lower two soil layers.

\section{Spatial, Temporal, and Situational Evaluation}

From this point forward in our analysis of the results we will focus exclusively on the best overall model, ``lstm-rsm-9'', with the goal of better understanding its performance in a variety of regional and meteorological scenarios.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering

    \includegraphics[width=.99\linewidth,draft=false]{figures/seq-eval_lstm-rsm-9/eval-grid_full_lstm-rsm-9_rsm-10_hist-humidity-temp_all-3.png}

    \caption{Joint histogram between temperature and absolute humidity (left) with increment mean absolute error (center) and bias (right) for the 0-10cm layer in corresponding bins (lstm-rsm-9; 2018-2023).}
    \label{bulk-eval_humidity-temp}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{bulk-eval_humidity-temp} demonstrates the model's performance at the surface layer with respect to the atmospheric temperature and humidity at each of the hourly prediction times. This includes data from all pixels within the CONUS domain throughout the test period from 2018 to 2023 inclusively. A few features stand out immediately: the highest overall error rates were associated with air near saturation and above freezing, which represent a strong dry bias. The removal water from surface layer by plant transpiration and bare-surface evaporation is limited by the potential evaporation given by the Penman relationship as estimated in the formulation from \parencite{mahrt_influence_1984}, which is inversely related to the relative humidity. As the air approaches saturation, the potential evaporation diminishes to only include a term dependent on the difference between the net radiation at the surface and the flux of heat to the soil, which is negative during the night time. As such, one possible explanation for the cause of error near saturation is that the ANNs are insufficient at accounting for the discrete halting of evapotranspiration under these atmospheric conditions, which would lead to unrealistic removal of water from the soil column and a subsequent dry bias like the one observed. Additionally, there is a steep jump in average error rates just above the freezing point, especially when the air is close to saturation. Here, the model has a considerable dry bias, while values just below freezing in the same humidity range tended to have a slight dry bias.

It is also important to recognize that regional meteorology can create hidden factors that must be considered in the interpretation of a forcing histogram like this one. For example, very warm and saturated air is considerably more common in the South and Southeast US as Figure \ref{gs-forcings} suggests, so the corresponding areas in Figure \ref{bulk-eval_humidity-temp} will be dominated by a subset of pixels from those regions. It is difficult to marginalize over all of these variables, so further analysis is needed to draw confident conclusions about model behavior.

\begin{figure}[hp!]
    \centering

    \includegraphics[width=.99\linewidth,draft=false]{figures/seq-eval_lstm-rsm-9/eval-grid_full_lstm-rsm-9_rsm-10_hist-state-increment_bias.png}

    \label{bulk-eval_state-increment}
\end{figure}

Now consider Figure \ref{bulk-eval_state-increment}, which demonstrates how the bias in increment change is related to the RSM and rate of change of RSM throughout the test period. A dominant pattern in all of the soil layers and for all of the models we tested is that the magnitude of wetting and drying rates were both mainly under-estimated. That is, when the RSM in a layer was decreasing, the predicted rate of decrease was too slow, and when RSM was increasing, the models' predictions for the increment change were too low. This effect is more severe as the magnitude of the increment change increases in either direction.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.99\linewidth,draft=false]{figures/grid-eval_qtrly/eval-grid_full_lstm-rsm-9_pixelwise-time-stats_monthly-txtr-abs-err-state-rsm-10.png}

    \caption{Overall monthly mean absolute error in RSM state at each depth level (lstm-rsm-9; 2018-2023).}
    \label{bulk-eval_monthly_txtr-error_rsm-10}
\end{figure}

Let us now consider how model performance is related to seasonal change. Figure \ref{bulk-eval_monthly_txtr-error_rsm-10} shows how the mean error rates vary seasonally for each unique soil texture in the 0-10cm layer, and Figure \ref{bulk-eval_qtrly_rsm-10} separates the spatial plots of mean absolute error and bias for the same layer into seasonal groupings that are averaged over all six years in the test period. In the surface layer during the winter, sand and loamy sand texture dominate much of the error, most notably in Michigan, upper Nebraska, and in sand-dominant regions scattered throughout the desert west like Central Washington, the Navajo Nation, and West Texas. Nonetheless, other sandy regions with warmer climates like Southeast Texas and Florida didn't see significantly degraded performance during the winter season, which leads us to suspect that the model struggles to capture the dynamics of frozen or partially-frozen sandy soil. In general, these high-error regions correspond to a wet bias, with the notable exception of the Nebraska sand hills.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \label{bulk-eval_qtrly_rsm-10}
\end{figure}

The 0-10cm layer also showed error maxima on either side of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, however as Figure \ref{bulk-eval_monthly-elev-err_rsm-10} suggests, this winter error maximum was limited to altitudes in the range of about 1,000-2,500m. The highest peaks above 2,500m showed lower average error rates than at all other altitudes during this period of time. Moving into the spring season, however, this situation reverses such that the average absolute error rates are significantly higher going up in altitude. By May, the high peaks exhibit a strong wet bias that persists but gradually wanes through the summer and fall seasons.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering

    \includegraphics[width=.99\linewidth,draft=false]{figures/grid-eval_qtrly/eval-grid_full_lstm-rsm-9_pixelwise-time-stats_abs-err_qtrly-horizon-apcp.png}

    \caption{Quarterly mean precipitation distribution during the test period ($\frac{cm}{hr}$; 2018-2023).}
    \label{bulk-eval_qtrly-precip}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{bulk-eval_qtrly-precip} shows that the highest average precipitation rates observed anywhere within the domain fall on the Sierra Nevadas, Cascades, and the Northwest Coast during the winter season. At high altitudes, this will almost invariably be in the form of snow, which is not immediately infiltrated into the soil column. This suggests that the high error rates observed in the foothills during the winter and subsequently on the mountain peaks in the spring may be associated with the snow pack melting rather than snowfall itself.

While some sandy regions in Nebraska and the Midwest still exhibit high error rates in the surface layer during the spring season, clay-dominant soils begin to cause more issues moving into the Summer, especially in the South surrounding the Mississippi river and in Central/Southeastern Texas reliably associated with a wet bias, which is reflected in the time series from Figure \ref{bulk-eval_qtrly_rsm-10}. Similarly, pixels with urban surface types begin standing out with high error rates and a stark wet bias in the 0-10cm layer regardless of their soil texture. During the fall, the highest error rates in the surface layer were associated with a wet bias in the tallest peaks of the Sierra Nevadas and Colorado Rockies, along with the troublesome Nebraska sand hills. Notice that Figure \ref{bulk-eval_monthly-elev-err_rsm-10} shows two distinct error maxima associated with high altitudes in the spring and fall. If the snow and soil freeze-thaw process is indeed responsible for the high error rates observed in the mountains, the maximum in the fall is likely to be associated with the first transient snowfall events late in the season.

    \label{bulk-eval_qtrly_rsm-40}
\end{figure}

As Figure \ref{bulk-eval_qtrly_rsm-40} displays, the 10-40cm layer also saw relatively high error rates during the winter associated with the sandy regions mentioned previously including the Four Corners region of the Desert West and Northern Michigan. There were also winter error maxima associated with the mountainous regions of Washington, Oregon, and California with a strong wet bias in the Cascades and Northern Coast Ranges, which contrasted a stark dry bias in the southern extent of the Sierra Nevadas. Curiously, the Colorado Rockies performed very well during the same time frame compared to the surrounding regions.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \label{bulk-eval_qtrly_temp}
\end{figure}

During the winter in the 10-40cm layer, also consider the widespread meridional band of higher error rates around 0.02 RSM which spans a variety of soil textures from Missouri through the Midwest, Kentucky, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. This area is bounded by regions of lower average error to the North in the High Plains and Wisconsin, and broadly in the South and Southeast. Moving into the spring time frame, similar high error rates seem to migrate northward, resulting in error similarly spanning soil textures in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Dakotas. This may be owed in part to the northward movement of the latitude at which the air temperature more commonly fluctuates above and below freezing as winter gives way to spring. Such fluctuations complicate the soil freezing and thawing process, and Figure \ref{bulk-eval_qtrly_temp} suggests that the freezing line of the average air temperature seasonally expands and recedes over this area. Another factor may be the higher precipitation rates in those regions evident from Figure \ref{bulk-eval_qtrly-precip}, or a combination of the two.

    \caption{Monthly LAI per vegetation type, scaled by each category's minimum stomatal resistance parameter.}
    \label{veg-lai-scaled}
\end{figure}

As spring transitions into summer, the ANN is prone to a widespread wet bias throughout much of the Great Plains, Central Midwest, and Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Throughout the domain, this bias closely aligns with the cropland vegetation type more than any individual soil texture, which is discretely evident in the Sacramento Valley, Northwest Oregon, Southern Georgia, and Eastern North Carolina. This period of time coincides with the peak green vegetation fraction over the same regions as Figure \ref{gs-vegetation} indicates, which suggests that plant transpiration is much more efficient at removing water from the soil column in Noah-LSM. Furthermore, within the Jarvis plant model the LAI of each vegetation class is scaled by a minimum stomatal resistance coefficient in order to determine the uptake efficiency. Figure \ref{veg-lai-scaled} demonstrates that during the summer months, the lower minimum stomatal resistance of cropland vegetation gives it much stronger seasonality than all other surface classes, which means the efficiency of plant transpiration oscillates more dramatically than any other vegetation category, assuming the other components of the plant model -- for example plant-available water and dewpoint depression -- are the same. Underestimation of these enhanced transpiration rates may account in part for the wet bias.

\end{figure}


Also during the summertime, clay emerges as the soil texture with the highest error rates in the 10-40cm layer. This phenomenon is most evident in the Mississippi Alluvial Plains and central Alabama, but is also noticable in Northwest Ohio and Southeast Texas. These correspond to a strong wet bias that peaks in June and July, then slowly recedes into the winter time, as Figure \ref{bulk-eval_monthly_txtr-bias_rsm-40}. The clay-dominant Mississippi Alluvial region also coincides with cropland vegetation types, which may exacerbate the wet bias mentioned in the previous section. The fall months have the lowest error rates overall in the 10-40cm layer, with sparse pixels on the highest peaks of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges being the worst offenders during that time.

\end{figure}


Figure \ref{bulk-eval_qtrly_rsm-100} shows that in the 40-100cm layer, the regions with the highest error rates largely follow the pattern of the 10-40cm layer in all of the seasons. The Sierra Nevadas and Cascades performed the worst during the winter and spring, which coincides with the period of extreme precipitation in the same region. Like the 10-40cm layer, the Colorado Rockies and other regions of the Mountain West performed substantially better in the winter, though. The high error rates and dry bias associated with the slowest-draining tiles of the slopetype parameter (Figure \ref{slopetype-classes}) are more significant at 40-100cm than the higher layers, which makes sense because they are most directly impacted by variability in the rate of water removal from the bottom of the soil column. By the summer time, the wet bias associated with cropland is also noticable, especially surrounding the Missouri River and in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain where cropland is juxtaposed with silty clay and clay soils, respectively, which is reflected by Figure \ref{bulk-eval_monthly_txtr-bias_rsm-100}. Like the other layers, the 40-100cm range had the lowest overall error rates and the most modest biases in the fall than in all other seasons, however the highest peaks of the Colorado Rockies struggled with a dry bias.

    \label{weasd-hists}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{weasd-hists} shows the performance of the best LSTM-RSM model in terms of the joint distribution of the snow amount and surface temperature, which reveals important characteristics of the ANN's behavior with respect to cold weather processes. When the air temperature is below freezing, average error rates generally remain below .0005 RSM per hour, except when the snow pack is very shallow. As the temperature gets even colder, error rates continue to steadily decline. Above freezing, however, the average error is suddenly considerably higher when snow is present, on the order of .01 RSM per hour. These are associated with a stark dry bias. For low snow volumes close to freezing on the surface layer, there is a distinct couplet where just below freezing higher MAE and a wet bias contrast a dry bias just above freezing.

In Noah-LSM, the cold season processes introduced by \parencite{koren_parameterization_1999} add significant complexity to the soil dynamics by simulating fractionally frozen soil and snowpack physics. The new parameterization closely couples the soil hydrology with the thermodynamic model by using the soil layer temperature to simulate the phase change of water and thermal insulation by a variable-density snowpack. Frozen water is excluded the diffusive Richards calculation for water flux between layers, which makes the hydraulic conductivity extremely sensitive to the vertical profile of ice content. Additionally, the infiltration rate is modified by a parameter dependent on the quartz content of the soil texture that approximates the spatial fraction of impermeable surface soil. Furthermore, the rate of snow melt depends on the ``effective snow-ground surface temperature,'' which is empirically determined based on the thermal energy balance between the incident atmospheric radiation, the snow pack, and the surface layer, which in turn rely on an exponential equation for estimating subgrid snow albedo introduced by \parencite{barlage_noah_2010}. Given the complicated behavior of partially frozen soil and snowpack melting within Noah-LSM, as well as the absence of critical soil temperature information as a predictor, it isn't surprising that the ANNs struggle in these scenarios.

\section{Regional Analyses}

In this section, we will take a closer look at the behavior of the best LSTM-RSM model within several sub-regions in order to better understand the phenomena within Noah-LSM that present the biggest challenges for emulation by the ANNs. Based on our observations from the previous sections, we selected the Northern High Plains (including the Nebraska Sand Hills), the Mississippi Alluvial Plains and the Sierra Nevada Mountains for further analysis.

\subsection{Northern High Plains}

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Elevation (left) soil texture (center) and vegetation type (right) static parameters within the Northern High Plains regional subset. Selected pixels are circled in red.}
    \label{lt_static_high-plains}
\end{figure}

The first area we will focus on spans the border between central Nebraska and South Dakota. As Figure \ref{lt_static_high-plains} shows, this region has a substantial elevation gradient increasing to the southeast. The southern half of the area is dominated by the Nebraska Sand Hills, while the northern half has clay and silty clay interspersed with loamy soil textures. Most of the vegetation is classified as a grassland, however the eastern extent of the region has cropland juxtaposed with each of the dominant soil textures as well as some sparse wooded grasslands and a single water pixel. We chose this region mainly in order to investigate the cause of the consistent high error rates associated with sandy region, however the diversity of elevations and soil textures as well as the presence of the cropland vegetation offers opportunities for other analysis.

\begin{figure}[hp!]

    \label{lt_true-rsm_high-plains}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{lt_true-rsm_high-plains} shows the seasonal hydrology characteristic of this region. During the warm season, the average soil water content for the top two layers is generally between .3 and .5 RSM, while the lower layers are typically drier. In each of the layers during the same time, the water levels are stratified by soil texture with finer textures like clay being wetter. The variability of RSM in all layers was is considerably more variable during the warm season, which is related to the much slower exchange of water between soil layers when the ground is seasonally frozen during the winter. In the cold season, the soil water content is usually much closer to saturation, especially in the surface layer. In the lower two layers, clay-like soils are almost entirely inert once the ground freezes in the fall, taking on a consistent RSM value that depends on the extent of dry-down after the summer rains. This equilibrium is usually established in late October and lasts until March in the 40-100cm layer.

\end{figure}

The monthly mean values of atmospheric forcings within this region during the test period are displayed by Figure \ref{lt_monthly-forcings_high-plains}, which shows that the majority of the precipitation falls as rain during the warm season. The average magnitude of precipitation peaks in May and gradually declines for the rest of the year, with the exception of a slight secondary peak associated with snowfall in December. The region experiences a substantial seasonal snowpack with a peak volume in January. Furthermore, the average surface temperature is below freezing in December, January, and February, which corresponds to the period of time when the ground is at least partially frozen.

    \label{lt_mae-bias_high-plains}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{lt_mae-bias_high-plains} displays the average error rates and biases in each layer per season. During the winter, it is clear that the worst-performing areas in every layer are closely associated with the sandy soil texture, however these high error rates don't correspond to a strong bias in either direction. As the ground thaws in the spring, the clay soil textures in the Northern portion of the region have higher error rates in the first two layers, though these also aren't conclusively associated with strong bias: even in the surface layer, which is typically dry-biased in all seasons, there are some clay textures with a wet bias in the March-May time range.

    \label{lt_txtr-biases_high-plains}
\end{figure}

By the warm season, the highest error rates align closely with the clay-dominant textures; these have a clear wet bias in the lower two layers. Although the spatial plots don't clearly reveal a strong relationship between error rates or biases related to the cropland vegetation type, Figure \ref{lt_txtr-biases_high-plains} suggests that the enhanced seasonal transpiration rates of cropland corresponds to more of a wet bias in every soil texture than other vegetation types, which is consistent with results from the broader domain.

    \label{lt_sequence-c01_high-plains}
\end{figure}

Now let us consider the model prediction sequences from a few individually selected pixels in order to directly observe the way the ANN behaviors compare to Noah-LSM. We chose three pixels with silty loam, sand, and clay textures, and uniformly grassland vegetation types from the center of the domain; these are circled in red in Figure \ref{lt_static_high-plains}. The first case we focus on covers the time period between December 15 and 29, 2021; the forcings and model results are displayed in Figure \ref{lt_sequence-c01_high-plains}. At the beginning of the prediction period, all pixels start with a significant snow pack between 12-16 $kg\,m^{-2}$, which incrementally melts through the following 2 weeks. Temperatures are above freezing for most of the first day initially causing some snow melt in all three pixels. That night, a snowfall event partially restores some of the snow pack. This was followed by several days of mainly below-freezing temperatures. At the beginning of the second week, the surface temperature is generally warmer, which causes the snow pack to incrementally melt.

The sandy pixel state remains effectively at saturation throughout the time period, only drying slightly as soil moisture percolates to the lower layers, then being restored to saturation with the melting of the snow pack. The ANN doesn't maintain the saturated conditions at the surface layer, but the RSM of the pixel remains above .9 for the entire period. Under such saturated conditions, and with much drier layers below, sand would normally drain at an incredibly fast rate, which suggests that the ANN is still to some extent capturing the effect of snow melt on the surface layer.

In the second layer, the moisture content of the sandy pixel increases dramatically from an RSM value of about .36 to greater than .7, with the highest rate of change being between forecast hour 24 and 100. During this period of rapid increase, the surface temperature remains below freezing, and the snow pack volume remains unchanged, however the moisture content of the even drier 40-100cm layer quickly diminishes. We suspect that the cause of this odd behavior within Noah-LSM is that the 10-40cm likely has a higher fraction of frozen water due to the recent onset of freezing temperatures. Frozen soil moisture is left out of the Richards equation as described in the discussion following Figure \ref{weasd-hists}, which can cause rapid diffusion between lower layers due to enhanced capillary action. This is analogous to the physical phenomenon of ice needles forming on the land surface after a rapid freeze as described in \parencite{lawler_observations_1989}. Although the ANN underestimates the rate of decline in moisture content in the 40-100cm layer, it performs well in the 10-40cm layer. As the snow pack continues to melt and the soil layers thaw in the second week, the layer 2 moisture content rises at a slower rate, and drain once again to the third layer. Here, the ANN struggles to anticipate the steep rate of increase in RSM in the 40-100cm layer.

\begin{figure}[h!p]
    \centering

    \includegraphics[width=.98\linewidth,draft=false]{figures/lt-high-plains/eval-grid_lt-high-plains-c06_lstm-rsm-9_rsm_keep-all_bias_forcings.png}

    \label{lt_sequence-c06_high-plains}
\end{figure}

Due to their much lower hydraulic conductivity and larger B parameter, the finer soil textures are relatively inert throughout the time period, especially in the lower layers; this behavior is characteristic of partially frozen soils with small particle sizes. In the surface layer, the overall performance is strongly related to how well the ANN captures the magnitude of change associated with the brief period of soil thawing and snow pack melting. Although it captures the timing of jumps in RSM associated with melting, as well as the frozen soil behavior in intermittent times, the ANN underestimates the magnitude of change associated with all three of the infiltration events for the clay pixel, which leads to an overall dry bias at the surface. In contrast, the ANN generally overestimates the rate of infiltration for the silty loam pixel. When the temperature briefly exceeds freezing just past forecast hour 100, the silty loam pixel increases in RSM as tough it anticipates some snow melt, while Noah-LSM maintains the snow pack at the same level. Later in the week, Noah-LSM shows some water moving from the 0-10cm layer to the 10-40cm layer. Although the ANN correspondingly increases the moisture content of the 10-40cm layer, it underestimates the magnitude, and falsely maintains the RSM of the surface layer. The clay pixel's lower layers remain almost entirely constant throughout the time period, which is sufficiently captured by the ANN.

Figure \ref{lt_sequence-c06_high-plains} shows the forcing and model result time series for a warm-season case associated with the same three pixels as the previous discussion. During this period of time, the temperature remains well above freezing, and the dynamics are dominated by several considerably rainfall events followed by periods of dry-down. In the surface layer, the ANN is generally skillful at capturing the magnitude of the spike in RSM associated with infiltration, as well as the subsequent rapid decrease as water percolates downward. The grassland vegetation type of all three of these pixels has a more constrained LAI and generally lower GVF than cropland, but has the same minimum stomatal resistance and is similarly strongly seasonal as Figure \ref{veg-lai-scaled} suggests. The diurnal oscillation during drydown periods is mainly caused by root uptake; under-estimation of the rate in decline due to root transpiration seems to be the main cause of the wet bias in the lowest layer, which is common between all three soil textures.

\subsection{Mississippi Alluvial Plains}

    \label{lt_static_miss-alluvial}
\end{figure}

Next, let us investigate the region surrounding the southern extent of the Mississippi river including Louisiana, southwestern Mississippi, and the southeastern tip of Arkansas. This area is mainly occupied by the lowlands of the alluvial plans, which largely consists of cropland with clay and silty loam soil texture. The slightly higher-elevation portions of Arkansas and Mississippi have diverse forested vegetation types with a mixture of silty and sandy loam soil textures. The bayou surrounding the coast is one of the rare regions with the organic material soil. We chose this region in order to take a closer look at the poor warm-season performance of the clay and cropland soil textures, and to observe the behavior of the model in the warm maritime climate of the deep south.

    \label{lt_mae-bias_miss-alluvial}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{lt_true-rsm_miss-alluvial} shows the seasonality of RSM in the Mississippi Alluvial region in each of the layers throughout the test period, which is strongly tied to the soil texture, and the vegetation types associated with each soil texture. All of the soils oscillate between more moist conditions in the winter and drier in the summer, though the maxima and minima associated with the silty and sandy loam textures with woodland or evergreen needleleaf vegetation are far more muted than those of the more clay-dominant textures that are generally juxtaposed with cropland. Clay-like soils in the first two layers vary between .65 RSM in the winter and .4 in summer time, while at 40-100cm layer they tend to peak near .7 RSM in February before drying to below .3 in the Fall. The annual variation of the woodland and evergreen pixels at the margins of the region is far more modest, such that all three layers maintain a RSM of $.5\pm.1$, with the exception of the extreme drought of late 2023.

%\end{figure}

Figure \ref{lt_mae-bias_miss-alluvial} puts into perspective how the ANN struggles to capture the warm season dry-down periods. The most severe wet biases closely contour the cropland vegetation type, with the worst pixels overall being those which also have clay soil textures. These represent the highest average seasonal error rates 40-100cm layer out of of any region in the model domain, and one of the only scenarios where the error rates in the lower soil layers were higher than those above.

\begin{figure}[h!p]

    \label{lt_sequence-c01_miss-alluvial}
\end{figure}

In order to better understand the Noah-LSM properties ANN behaviors causing this bias, we selected four pixels which are circled in Figure \ref{lt_static_miss-alluvial}. These include three pixels with cropland vegetation and distinct soil textures including silty loam, sandy loam, and clay, as well as a single clay pixel with wooded grassland vegetation instead. Figure \ref{lt_sequence-c01_miss-alluvial} displays the relevant forcings alongside the Noah-LSM outputs and ANN predictions.

The time period we consider is at the peak of the warm season, from July 10 to July 24, 2023; this is the start of a severe drought as reflected by the very dry lower soil levels. During the two weeks, there are three precipitation events that affect all four pixels to some extent, with the intervening time mainly being affected by the diurnal cycle of drydown from evapotranspiration. In the surface layer, the ANN slightly overestimates the extent of infiltration from the rainfall events, but otherwise performs fairly well in capturing the subsequent drainage just after rainfall, and the overall trend of the diurnal drying. In the lower layers, however, a distinct trend of wet biases in the cropland-vegetated pixels emerges, which is consistent with the bulk observations of the region.

In the 10-40cm and 40-100cm layer, the wooded grassland clay pixel starts with a considerably RSM due to the relatively slow rate of transpiration associated with that vegetation type in the warm season (see Figure \ref{veg-lai-scaled}). In both of these layers, the ANN predicts a relatively modest diurnal signal, and stays well within .01 RSM of the Noah-LSM target. In contrast, the cropland pixels dry rapidly in spite of their lower moisture content. In the 40-100cm layer, the initial RSM of the sandy loam pixel is the same as the cropland-vegetated clay pixel, but the Noah-LSM dry-down rate of the clay pixel is notably faster. This is likely the consequence of the surface layer being .2 RSM wetter in the clay pixel than the sandy loam pixel. In the Jarvis plant model, the root uptake efficiency is modulated by a coefficient of the weighted sum of the fraction water content between the wilting point and the field capacity in each of the layers, then the subsequent total volume of plant transpiration is distributed between the layers proportional to their depth. Since the moisture content of the lower two layers is approximately the same in the clay and sandy loam pixels, the wetness of the surface layer likely accounts for the discrepancy. Notice also that the Noah-LSM RSM of the clay pixel in the 40-100cm layer actually dips below the wilting point due to plant transpiration. Although it is physically unrealistic, the process of calculating the total plant-available water for the full column, then distributing the transpiration between layers according to their depth accounts for this phenomenon.

%Although the clay pixel has higher water potential and is therefore more prone to retain water against a pressure gradient such as that imposed by vegetation, clay counterintuitively also has a higher porosity. As a consequence, the same RSM value corresponds to a higher water mass content,

\begin{figure}[h!p]
    \centering

    \includegraphics[width=.85\linewidth,draft=false]{figures/lt-miss-alluvial/eval-grid_lt-miss-alluvial-c01_lstm-rsm-9_rsm_keep-all_bias_res-seq-textures-all.png}

    \caption{Increment change in RSM for the 40-100cm layer, separated by soil texture. True values are solid, while ANN predictions are dotted.}
    \label{lt_sequence-c01-res_miss-alluvial}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{lt_sequence-c01-res_miss-alluvial} compares the increment change in RSM per hour from Noah-LSM to the ANN predictions during the same period of time. Since each layer gets drier moving downward, the diurnal oscillation of the lower layers can't correspond to upward diffusion of water. All of the soils remain below their field capacity as well, so downward percolation due to the influence of gravity is also not a factor in the soil moisture response. Downward diffusion due to the upward moisture gradient may have some influence on the dry-down, however those effects would not be limited to the daytime. Therefore, we are confident that plant transpiration is the dominant process affecting the daily reduction in moisture content in the lower layers. Looking closely at the magnitudes of dry-down during the day, the Noah-LSM peak drydown rate for wooded grassland is about $-5\times10^{-4}$ RSM per hour, which closely aligns with all of the predictions. The actual dry-down rates for the farmland, however, are about three times steeper. In support of our supposition from the bulk statistics, this demonstrates that although the models capture the overall diurnal trend of plant transpiration, they struggle with the high magnitude of transpiration associated with the strongly seasonal cropland vegetation category.

%Finally, we focus in on the highest peaks of the Sierra Nevada range and the surrounding regions on either side of the ridge, spanning the diagonal portion of the California-Nevada border. The southeastern extent of this domain contains the depths of the San Joaquin valley, which are dominated by the wine country cropland, covering a mixture of sandy loam and clay soils. The windward foothills have wooded grasslands and more loamy soil textures, while the higher peaks of the west range are covered by woodland and evergreen needleleaf forests and sandy soil textures. On the arid lee side of the range, shrubland and bare surfaces are most common, which mostly occupy sandy loam soils, with scattered loam textures, and a few clay pixels in the Northern extent. This region was chosen for further analysis due to the complex results associated with mountainous regions, but it also offers opportunities to observe how the model behaves for area with uniquely seasonal precipitation, as well as in the arid environment of great basin.

\section{Predictor and Loss Function Variations}

\noindent
In this section, we seek to understand the dependence of the model's performance on the inclusion of each of the predictors from Noah-LSM, and to investigate how the loss function manipulations we implemented affect model performance.

\subsection{Predictor Importance Testing}

In order to assess feature importance, we re-trained the best LSTM-RSM ANN with exactly the same configuration, except with individual predictors excluded. Table \ref{feat-variants-table-1} and Figure \ref{feat-variants} display the results. The table includes the importance rank of each feature with respect to the mean absolute error and fractional information of each layer. Here, lower numbers correspond to more degraded performance when the feature is excluded (higher MAE, lower FI). Where the rank is left blank, the feature-excluded model performed on par with or better than the original model for that layer/metric combination.

Precipitation was unsurprisingly the most critical predictor for all layers. Soil texture was definitively the second-most important in all layers, which corroborates that the models are able to capture the unique dynamics of different soils when the texture is provided. Beyond that, the importance results are more mixed between metrics and layers. Snow water equivalent was generally the third most important, however in the surface layer although it substantially increased average error rates when excluded, its fractional information rank suggests that other features had a stronger relationship with the global statistical uncertainty.

Downward shortwave radiation was the next-most significant predictor in the surface layer followed by temperature and green vegetation fraction, which reflects these variables' importance in determining the surface energy balance as well as bare surface evaporation and transpiration rates. Wind magnitude and humidity weren't conclusively important predictors in the first two layers, however excluding each decreased the fractional information a somewhat in the first layer. Humidity and GVF were both important for the 40-100cm layer, which is likely a consequence of those variable's the efficiency of root water uptake by vegetation.

Models with the leaf area index, surface pressure, and elevation inputs excluded during training performed better in each of the layers than the base model, which suggests that their inclusion enabled the models to learn faulty generalizations or contributed useless variability in the input data. In order to confirm this result, we trained an additional model that excluded all three. The results listed in Table \ref{feat-variants-table-2} reaffirm that these weren't meaningful predictors, as the mean absolute error decreased and fractional information increased in all three layers with LAI, pressure, and elevation left out.

Although LAI is a significant coefficient in the plant model, it is calculated in terms of a linear relationship to GVF with upper and lower bounds determined uniquely for each vegetation type. As such, its inclusion as a separate predictor is redundant when the vegetation category and green vegetation fraction are also provided to the model. Elevation also does not explicitly appear as a parameter within Noah-LSM (although it is used to rescale the forcing data using lapse rate calculations). Elevation was originally included as a model input because we suspected it would be a useful covariate given the apparent sensitivity of models in mountainous terrain, however since it isn't a component of any of the land surface calculations, it makes sense that it wouldn't contribute useful information. Surface pressure is indeed a component of the canopy resistance formulation from \parencite{ek_osu_1991}, however it is only present in a term that is dominated by a fourth-power relationship with air temperature.

\subsection{Loss Function Manipulation Evaluation}

The loss function parameters we introduced in Equation \ref{loss-fn} include the increment loss ratio $\rho$, the magnitude bias $\gamma$, and the layerwise normalization coefficients $\lambda_i$ for each layer indexed by $i$. Here, we retrained the best LSTM-RSM model we identified while only manipulating one of these parameters at a time in order to observe their effect on the results. The bulk statistics for these model variations are recorded in Table \ref{loss-variants-table}, along with a model trained to optimize the mean squared error rather than mean absolute error.

At first glance, it appears that including the magnitude bias parameter diminished model performance overall. The LSTM trained with $\gamma=0$ had higher fractional information at every soil layer than the original model with $\gamma=10$, and higher values continued to progressively decrease the fractional information and increase the mean absolute error at each level.

Figure \ref{hists-increment} shows the ``true'' distributions of increment change in soil moisture for each of the layers, which demonstrates that very small hourly changes in soil water content are dramatically more common than large changes. As such, soil evolution close to equilibrium dominate the training set, and models that more effective at consistently predicting these small changes are likely to perform better overall in terms of bulk statistics. Figure \ref{loss-fn-error-wrt-increment} shows the mean absolute error and error bias of each of the models with modified magnitude bias on the same value range as the histograms for each layer.

\end{figure}

When the true hourly increment change in soil moisture is close to zero the unmodified model with $\gamma=0$ tends to have slightly lower mean absolute error rates, however for more rapid increases or decreases in moisture content, some of the modified models tend to perform considerably better. At the surface layer, the MAE of the model with $\gamma=10$ starts exceeding the performance of the unmodified model at about $\pm$0.01 RSM per hour, while for the 10-40cm and 40-100cm layers the performance of modified models is better at about $\pm$0.0025 and $\pm$0.003, respectively. In the top two layers, the average bias of models with nonzero $\gamma$ is generally diminished compared to the unmodified model, except in the lowest layer where dry-down is less biased for the $\gamma=0$ model until the rate of decrease in RSM is greater than $-0.0025$ per hour. Despite the sensitivity of the MSE loss function to outliers, the error rates with respect to increment change in Figure \ref{loss-fn-error-wrt-increment} suggest that it demonstrated considerably higher error rates than the other variants in the full spectrum of values. Furthermore, the bulk statistics in Table \ref{loss-variants-table} show that the model trained with MSE performed considerably worse in all metrics and for all layers, so we are confident in concluding that mean absolute error was the right choice for the basic element of the loss function.

\end{figure}

We also tested models with the target values of increment change in RSM normalized by the standard deviation of the true increment changes in each layer in order for the distributions of each to approximate a unit gaussian. The coefficients were determined to be $\lambda_1=0.0323$, $\lambda_2=0.0106$, and $\lambda_3=0.00384$ for the 0-10cm, 10-40cm, and 40-100cm layers, respectively. In effect, this modification scales the loss contribution of each layer so that they operate on the same value scale on average; since the lower layers have smaller standard deviations, the modified model will be penalized relatively more for errors in the lower layers. Figure \ref{loss-fn-norm-horizons} compares the mean absolute error in RSM state of each layer with respect to the forecast hour, which demonstrates that using the normalization coefficients decreases average performance in the de-emphasized surface layer, slightly increases performance later in the forecast for the 10-40cm layer, and more significantly lowers average error in the 40-100cm layer. In essence, changing the incentive structure of the model by normalizing inputs seems to offer the opportunity to ``trade'' prediction skill in one output for better performance in others.

The increment ratio parameter $\rho$ balances the error contribution at each prediction step between the immediate deviation of hourly increment change from the Noah-LSM value, and the deviation of the accumulated RSM state of the entire time series up to that point from the Noah-LSM state. $\rho=1$ indicates that the loss is fully dependent on error in increment change, while lower values allow a contribution from the state loss to factor into the prediction cost. Table \ref{loss-variants-table} shows that when $\rho=0.9995$, the top two soil layers perform slightly better than the unmodified model with $\rho=1.$, however the lowest layer maintains considerably lower fractional information.

    \label{loss-fn-ratio-horizons}
\end{figure}

As the contribution from state loss continues to increase with $\rho=.95$, the mean absolute error of the first two layers continues to improve significantly, but the fractional information decreases, which suggests that the modified models likely perform better under normal conditions, but uncertainty increases for edge cases. Even higher values of $\rho$ diminish model performance for all layers. The substantial improvements in average error given $\rho=.95$ is hopeful, but further analysis is needed to determine the consequences of the apparent increase in uncertainty implied by the lower fractional information scores of models with the modified increment ratio parameter.
