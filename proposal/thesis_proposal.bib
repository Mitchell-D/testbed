	abstract = {Abstract Soil information is now widely required by many climate and hydrology models and soil–vegetation–atmosphere transfer schemes. This paper describes the development of a multilayer soil characteristics dataset for the conterminous United States (CONUS-SOIL) that specifically addresses the need for soil physical and hydraulic property information over large areas. The State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO) developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture–Natural Resources Conservation Service served as the starting point for CONUS-SOIL. Geographic information system and Perl computer programming language tools were used to create map coverages of soil properties including soil texture and rock fragment classes, depth-to-bedrock, bulk density, porosity, rock fragment volume, particle-size (sand, silt, and clay) fractions, available water capacity, and hydrologic soil group. Interpolation procedures for the continuous and categorical variables describing these soil properties were developed and applied to the original STATSGO data. In addition to any interpolation errors, the CONUS-SOIL dataset reflects the limitations of the procedures used to generate detailed county-level soil survey data to the STATSGO map units. CONUS-SOIL is available in several formats and may be accessed via the World Wide Web.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of forcing data greatly impacts the ability of land surface models (LSMs) to produce realistic simulations of land surface processes. With this in mind, the multi-institutional North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) project has produced retrospective (1996–2002) and real-time (1999–present) data sets to support its LSM modeling activities. Featuring 0.125° spatial resolution, hourly temporal resolution, nine primary forcing fields, and six secondary validation/model development fields, each data set is based on a backbone of Eta Data Assimilation System/Eta data and is supplemented with observation-based precipitation and radiation data. Hourly observation-based precipitation data are derived from a combination of daily National Center for Environmental Prediction Climate Prediction Center (CPC) gauge-based precipitation analyses and hourly National Weather Service Doppler radar-based (WSR-88D) precipitation analyses, wherein the hourly radar-based analyses are used to temporally disaggregate the daily CPC analyses. NLDAS observation-based shortwave values are derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite radiation data processed at the University of Maryland and at the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service. Extensive quality control and validation efforts have been conducted on the NLDAS forcing data sets, and favorable comparisons have taken place with Oklahoma Mesonet, Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program/cloud and radiation test bed, and Surface Radiation observation data. The real-time forcing data set is constantly evolving to make use of the latest advances in forcing-related data sets, and all of the real-time and retrospective data are available online at http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov for visualization and downloading in both full and subset forms.},

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

	abstract = {Results are presented from the multi-institution partnership to develop a real-time and retrospective North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS). NLDAS consists of (1) four land models executing in parallel in uncoupled mode, (2) common hourly surface forcing, and (3) common streamflow routing: all using a 1/8° grid over the continental United States. The initiative is largely sponsored by the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Continental-Scale International Project (GCIP). As the overview for nine NLDAS papers, this paper describes and evaluates the 3-year NLDAS execution of 1 October 1996 to 30 September 1999, a period rich in observations for validation. The validation emphasizes (1) the land states, fluxes, and input forcing of four land models, (2) the application of new GCIP-sponsored products, and (3) a multiscale approach. The validation includes (1) mesoscale observing networks of land surface forcing, fluxes, and states, (2) regional snowpack measurements, (3) daily streamflow measurements, and (4) satellite-based retrievals of snow cover, land surface skin temperature (LST), and surface insolation. The results show substantial intermodel differences in surface evaporation and runoff (especially over nonsparse vegetation), soil moisture storage, snowpack, and LST. Owing to surprisingly large intermodel differences in aerodynamic conductance, intermodel differences in midday summer LST were unlike those expected from the intermodel differences in Bowen ratio. Last, anticipating future assimilation of LST, an NLDAS effort unique to this overview paper assesses geostationary-satellite-derived LST, determines the latter to be of good quality, and applies the latter to validate modeled LST.},

	abstract = {We tested four land surface parameterization schemes against long-term (5 months) area-averaged observations over the 15 km × 15 km First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) area. This approach proved to be very beneficial to understanding the performance and limitations of different land surface models. These four surface models, embodying different complexities of the evaporation/hydrology treatment, included the traditional simple bucket model, the simple water balance (SWB) model, the Oregon State University (OSU) model, and the simplified Simple Biosphere (SSiB) model. The bucket model overestimated the evaporation during wet periods, and this resulted in unrealistically large negative sensible heat fluxes. The SWB model, despite its simple evaporation formulation, simulated well the evaporation during wet periods, but it tended to underestimate the evaporation during dry periods. Overall, the OSU model ably simulated the observed seasonal and diurnal variation in evaporation, soil moisture, sensible heat flux, and surface skin temperature. The more complex SSiB model performed similarly to the OSU model. A range of sensitivity experiments showed that some complexity in the canopy resistance scheme is important in reducing both the overestimation of evaporation during wet periods and underestimation during dry periods. Properly parameterizing not only the effect of soil moisture stress but also other canopy resistance factors, such as the vapor pressure deficit stress, is critical for canopy resistance evaluation. An overly simple canopy resistance that includes only soil moisture stress is unable to simulate observed surface evaporation during dry periods. Given a modestly comprehensive time-dependent canopy resistance treatment, a rather simple surface model such as the OSU model can provide good area-averaged surface heat fluxes for mesoscale atmospheric models.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of Transformer-based solutions for the long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) task. Despite the growing performance over the past few years, we question the validity of this line of research in this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among the elements in a long sequence. However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in an ordered set of continuous points. While employing positional encoding and using tokens to embed sub-series in Transformers facilitate preserving some ordering information, the nature of the {\textbackslash}emph\{permutation-invariant\} self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss. To validate our claim, we introduce a set of embarrassingly simple one-layer linear models named LTSF-Linear for comparison. Experimental results on nine real-life datasets show that LTSF-Linear surprisingly outperforms existing sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models in all cases, and often by a large margin. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to explore the impacts of various design elements of LTSF models on their temporal relation extraction capability. We hope this surprising finding opens up new research directions for the LTSF task. We also advocate revisiting the validity of Transformer-based solutions for other time series analysis tasks (e.g., anomaly detection) in the future.

We use warm season, high-frequency, near-surface states and turbulent fluxes collected over nine sites in the U.S. Southern Great Plains. We quantify changes in the pattern of sensitive parameters, the amount and nature of the interaction between parameters, and the covariance structure of the distribution of behavioral parameter sets. Using Sobol′'s total and first-order sensitivity indexes, we show that few parameters directly control the variance of the model response. Significant parameter interaction occurs. Optimal parameter values differ between models, and the relationships between parameters also change. GW decreases unwarranted parameter interaction and appears to improve model realism, especially at wetter study sites. DV increases parameter interaction and decreases identifiability, implying it is overparameterized and/or underconstrained. At a wet site, GW has two functional modes: one that mimics STD and a second in which GW improves model function by decoupling direct evaporation and base flow. Unsupervised classification of the posterior distributions of behavioral parameter sets cannot group similar sites based solely on soil or vegetation type, helping to explain why transferability between sites and models is not straightforward. Our results suggest that the a priori assignment of parameters should also consider the climatic conditions of a study location.},

	abstract = {Soil water-groundwater interactions are important in determining the moisture profile in a soil column. However, the Noah Land Surface Model (Noah LSM), the land surface component of several general circulation models, does not consider groundwater effects. The present study investigates the impact of integrating a groundwater model into the Noah LSM. By performing experiments forced by observations at the surface, insights into the characteristics of soil moisture evolution with and without the aquifer are investigated. In the absence of surface precipitation, soil moisture is shown to exhibit an exponential decay rate without the aquifer (termed as Noah-Cntl). This is because evapotranspiration dominates other processes governing the soil moisture evolution. Based on scale analysis, we derived an analytical equation that could well represent the aforementioned exponential variation in soil moisture. Presence of the aquifer (termed as Noah-GW) makes the capillary processes important as well. The result is a slower decay of soil moisture as compared to Noah-Cntl without surface precipitation. Soil moisture evolution in both the models is a function of vegetation and soil types. As a result, the aforementioned decay timescale displays significant heterogeneity over the Indian region, with Central India exhibiting relatively faster decay rates. We also performed 24-year long experiments with observed interannually varying forcing that indicates an enhancement in the annual mean soil moisture at all levels due to groundwater effects. This enhancement is particularly prominent during the post-monsoon season, reaffirming the results of the drain-out experiments mentioned above.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

An original model assumption that there is no significant heat transfer during redistribution of liquid water was relaxed by including a source/sink term in the heat transfer equation to account for latent heat during phase transitions of soil moisture. The parameterization uses the layer-integrated form of heat and water diffusion equations adopted by the original Eta-LSS. Therefore it simulates the total ice content of each selected soil layer. Infiltration reduction under frozen ground conditions was estimated by probabilistic averaging of spatially variable ice content of the soil profile. Off-line uncoupled tests of the new and original Eta-LSS were performed using experimental data from Rosemount, Minnesota. Simulated soil temperature and unfrozen water content matched observed data reasonably well. Neglecting frozen ground processes leads to significant underestimation/overestimation of soil temperature during soil freezing/thawing periods and underestimates total soil moisture content after extensive periods of soil freezing.},

	abstract = {Results are presented from the second phase of the multiinstitution North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2) research partnership. In NLDAS, the Noah, Variable Infiltration Capacity, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting, and Mosaic land surface models (LSMs) are executed over the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) in realtime and retrospective modes. These runs support the drought analysis, monitoring and forecasting activities of the National Integrated Drought Information System, as well as efforts to monitor large-scale floods. NLDAS-2 builds upon the framework of the first phase of NLDAS (NLDAS-1) by increasing the accuracy and consistency of the surface forcing data, upgrading the land surface model code and parameters, and extending the study from a 3-year (1997–1999) to a 30-year (1979–2008) time window. As the first of two parts, this paper details the configuration of NLDAS-2, describes the upgrades to the forcing, parameters, and code of the four LSMs, and explores overall model-to-model comparisons of land surface water and energy flux and state variables over the CONUS. Focusing on model output rather than on observations, this study seeks to highlight the similarities and differences between models, and to assess changes in output from that seen in NLDAS-1. The second part of the two-part article focuses on the validation of model-simulated streamflow and evaporation against observations. The results depict a higher level of agreement among the four models over much of the CONUS than was found in the first phase of NLDAS. This is due, in part, to recent improvements in the parameters, code, and forcing of the NLDAS-2 LSMs that were initiated following NLDAS-1. However, large inter-model differences still exist in the northeast, Lake Superior, and western mountainous regions of the CONUS, which are associated with cold season processes. In addition, variations in the representation of sub-surface hydrology in the four LSMs lead to large differences in modeled evaporation and subsurface runoff. These issues are important targets for future research by the land surface modeling community. Finally, improvement from NLDAS-1 to NLDAS-2 is summarized by comparing the streamflow measured from U.S. Geological Survey stream gauges with that simulated by four NLDAS models over 961 small basins.},

In addition, an assessment of ET estimates for current LDASs is provided along with current research that demonstrates improvement in LSM ET estimates due to assimilating satellite-based soil moisture products. Using the Ensemble Kalman Filter in the Land Information System, we assimilate both NASA and Land Parameter Retrieval Model soil moisture products into the Noah LSM Version 3.2 with the North American LDAS Phase 2 (NLDAS-2), forcing to mimic the NLDAS-2 configuration. Through comparisons with two global reference ET products, one based on interpolated flux tower data and one from a new satellite ET algorithm, over the NLDAS-2 domain, we demonstrate improvement in ET estimates only when assimilating the LPRM soil moisture product.

The study objective was to assess uncertainty in ET output from four land surface models (LSMs), Noah, Mosaic, VIC, and SAC in NLDAS-2, two remote sensing-based products, MODIS and AVHRR, and GRACE-inferred ET from a water budget with precipitation from PRISM, monitored runoff, and total water storage change (TWSC) from GRACE satellites. The three cornered hat method, which does not require a priori knowledge of the true ET value, was used to estimate ET uncertainties. In addition, TWSC or total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from GRACE was compared with water budget estimates of TWSC from a flux-based approach or TWSA from a storage-based approach. The analyses were conducted using data from three regions (humid-arid) in the South Central United States as case studies. Uncertainties in ET are lowest in LSM ET (∼5 mm/mo), moderate in MODIS or AVHRR-based ET (10–15 mm/mo), and highest in GRACE-inferred ET (20–30 mm/month). There is a trade-off between spatial resolution and uncertainty, with lower uncertainty in the coarser-resolution LSM ET (∼14 km) relative to higher uncertainty in the finer-resolution (∼1–8 km) RS ET. Root-mean-square (RMS) of uncertainties in water budget estimates of TWSC is about half of RMS of uncertainties in GRACE-derived TWSC for each of the regions. Future ET estimation should consider a hybrid approach that integrates strengths of LSMs and satellite-based products to constrain uncertainties.},

Here, we evaluate hourly ET using in situ observations over the Southern Great Plains (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement/Cloud and Radiation Testbed network) for 1 January 1997–30 September 1999 and daily ET u-sing in situ observations at the AmeriFlux network over the conterminous USA for an 8-year period (2000–2007). The NLDAS-2 models compare well against observations, with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's Noah land surface model performing best, followed, in order, by the Variable Infiltration Capacity, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting, and Mosaic models. Daily evaluation across the AmeriFlux network shows that for all models, performance depends on season and vegetation type; they do better in spring and fall than in winter or summer and better for deciduous broadleaf forest and grasslands than for croplands or evergreen needleleaf forest.

	abstract = {Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component of the surface hydrological cycle and controls land-atmosphere feedbacks by modulating the surface energy budget. Accurate ET quantification at global or regional scales is crucial for understanding variations in carbon and water cycling in a changing environment. Although various grid-based ET data models have been developed using multiple approaches, these vary in concept and physical scheme, leading to differences in performance. We examine uncertainties associated with the limitations of the physics used to assist in model selection and improvement. We evaluate multiple ET data models, including estimates derived from a variety of land surface models (LSMs) based on the operational North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) phase 2 (NLDAS-2) and the experimental NASA LIS-based NLDAS Testbed (NLDAS-Testbed) drivers, and satellite retrievals, compared to water budget-derived ET and tower observations. Overall, all models are able to capture the spatial variability of mean annual water balance-based ET (ETwb) and monthly seasonal cycles of tower ET measurements, although there is a large range of estimates. NOAH28, FLUXNET, SSEBop, LandFlux, and GLEAM perform best, as demonstrated by their higher correlation and smaller bias and RMSE values. Simple relative uncertainty analysis shows that the NLDAS-Testbed ensemble mean has a slightly lower uncertainty than that of the NLDAS-2 ensemble. Our study indicates that NLDAS-Testbed/VIC412 (NLDAS version/LSM version) is improving and NLDAS-Testbed /CLSM is deteriorating relative to NLDAS-2/VIC403 and NLDAS-2/Mosaic. NLDAS-Testbed /NOAH36 and NLDAS-Testbed /NOAHMP36 are comparable to NLDAS-2/NOAH28, although biases between models and ETwb exhibit opposite trends. These findings will help further improvement of these models and support future NLDAS development.},

	abstract = {The North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) phase 2 (NLDAS-2) has generated 31-years (1979–2008) of water and energy products from four state-of-the-art land surface models (Noah, Mosaic, SAC, VIC). The soil moisture data from these models have been used for operational drought monitoring activities, but so far have not yet been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, three available in situ soil moisture observation data sets in the United States were used to evaluate the model-simulated soil moisture for different time scales varying from daily to annual. First, we used the observed multiple layer monthly and annual mean soil moisture from the Illinois Climate Network to evaluate 20-years (January 1985–December 2004) of model-simulated soil moisture in terms of skill and analysis of error statistics. Second, we utilized 6-years (1 January 1997–31 December 2002) of daily soil moisture observed from 72 sites over the Oklahoma Mesonet network to assess daily and monthly simulation skill and errors for 3 model soil layers (0–10cm, 10–40cm, 40–100cm). Third, we extended the daily assessment to sites over the continental United States using 8-years (1 January 2002–31 December 2009) of observations for 121 sites from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). Overall, all models are able to capture wet and dry events and show high skill (in most cases, anomaly correlation is larger than 0.7), but display large biases when compared to in situ observations. These errors may come from model errors (i.e., model structure error, model parameter error), forcing data errors, and in situ soil moisture measurement errors. For example, all models simulate less soil moisture due to lack of modeled irrigation and ground water processes in Illinois, Oklahoma, and the other Midwest states.},

	abstract = {Abstract Soil moisture observations from seven observational networks (spanning portions of seven states) with different biome and climate conditions were used in this study to evaluate multimodel simulated soil moisture products. The four land surface models, including Noah, Mosaic, Sacramento soil moisture accounting (SAC), and the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC), were run within phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2), with a ⅛° spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution. Hundreds of sites in Alabama, Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, West Texas, and Utah were used to evaluate simulated soil moisture in the 0–10-, 10–40-, and 40–100-cm soil layers. Soil moisture was spatially averaged in each state to reduce noise. In general, the four models captured broad features (e.g., seasonal variation) of soil moisture variations in all three soil layers in seven states, except for the 10–40-cm soil layer in West Texas and the 40–100-cm soil layer in Alabama, where the anomaly correlations are weak. Overall, Mosaic, SAC, and the ensemble mean have the highest simulation skill and VIC has the lowest simulation skill. The results show that Noah and VIC are wetter than the observations while Mosaic and SAC are drier than the observations, mostly likely because of systematic errors in model evapotranspiration.},

The results show that these impacts are significant for most regions and soil layers, although they vary depending on soil texture classification, vegetation type, and season. The use of site-observed soil texture classification and vegetation type in the model does not necessarily improve anomaly correlations and reduce mean absolute error for soil moisture simulations. Instead, results are mixed when examining all regions and soil layers. This is attributed to the compensation effects (e.g., effect of ill-calibrated model parameters), as Noah has been more or less calibrated with model-specified soil texture classification and vegetation type. The site-based analysis shows that Noah can reasonably simulate the variation of daily evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and total runoff when soil texture classification (vegetation type) is corrected from loam (forest) to clay (grasslands) or vice versa. This suggests that the performance of Noah can be further improved by tuning model parameters when site-observed soil texture and vegetation type are used.},

	abstract = {Abstract The North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD) was initiated in 2011 to provide support for developing climate forecasting tools, calibrating land surface models, and validating satellite-derived soil moisture algorithms. The NASMD has collected data from over 30 soil moisture observation networks providing millions of in situ soil moisture observations in all 50 states, as well as Canada and Mexico. It is recognized that the quality of measured soil moisture in NASMD is highly variable because of the diversity of climatological conditions, land cover, soil texture, and topographies of the stations, and differences in measurement devices (e.g., sensors) and installation. It is also recognized that error, inaccuracy, and imprecision in the data can have significant impacts on practical operations and scientific studies. Therefore, developing an appropriate quality control procedure is essential to ensure that the data are of the best quality. In this study, an automated quality control approach is developed using the North American Land Data Assimilation System, phase 2 (NLDAS-2), Noah soil porosity, soil temperature, and fraction of liquid and total soil moisture to flag erroneous and/or spurious measurements. Overall results show that this approach is able to flag unreasonable values when the soil is partially frozen. A validation example using NLDAS-2 multiple model soil moisture products at the 20-cm soil layer showed that the quality control procedure had a significant positive impact in Alabama, North Carolina, and west Texas. It had a greater impact in colder regions, particularly during spring and autumn. Over 433 NASMD stations have been quality controlled using the methodology proposed in this study, and the algorithm will be implemented to control data quality from the other {\textasciitilde}1200 NASMD stations in the near future.},

The four LSMs are the baseline community Noah LSM (Noah, version 2.8), the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC, version 4.0.5) model, the substantially augmented Noah LSM with multiparameterization options (hence Noah-MP), and the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4). All four models are driven by the same NLDAS-2 atmospheric forcing. Modeled terrestrial water storage (TWS), streamflow, evapotranspiration (ET), and soil moisture are compared with each other and evaluated against the identical observations. Relative to Noah, the other three models offer significant improvements in simulating TWS and streamflow and moderate improvements in simulating ET and soil moisture. Noah-MP provides the best performance in simulating soil moisture and is among the best in simulating TWS, CLM4 shows the best performance in simulating ET, and VIC ranks the highest in performing the streamflow simulations. Despite these improvements, CLM4, Noah-MP, and VIC exhibit deficiencies, such as the low variability of soil moisture in CLM4, the fast growth of spring ET in Noah-MP, and the constant overestimation of ET in VIC.},

	abstract = {The Noah model is a land surface model of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. It has been widely used in regional coupled weather and climate models (i.e. Weather Research and Forecasting Model, Eta Mesoscale Model) and global coupled weather and climate models (i.e. National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System, Climate Forecast System). Therefore, its continued improvement and development are keys to enhancing our weather and climate forecast ability and water and energy flux simulation accuracy. North American Land Data Assimilation System phase 1 (NLDAS-1) experiments indicated that the Noah model exhibited substantial bias in latent heat flux, total runoff and land skin temperature during the warm season, and such bias can significantly affect coupled weather and climate models. This paper presents a study to improve the Noah model by adding model parameterization processes such as including seasonal factor on leaf area index and root distribution and selecting optimal model parameters. We compared simulated latent heat flux, mean annual runoff and land skin temperature from the Noah control and test versions with measured latent heat flux, land surface skin temperature, mean annual runoff and satellite-retrieved land surface skin temperature. The results show that the test version significantly reduces biases in latent heat, total runoff and land skin temperature simulation. The test version has been used for the NLDAS phase 2 (NLDAS-2) to produce 30-year water flux, energy flux and state variable products to support the US drought monitor of National Integrated Drought Information System.

The first part concentrates on a model-by-model comparison of mean annual and monthly water fluxes, energy fluxes and state variables. In this second part, the focus is on the validation of simulated streamflow from four land surface models (Noah, Mosaic, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA), and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) models) and their ensemble mean. Comparisons are made against 28-years (1 October 1979–30 September 2007) of United States Geological Survey observed streamflow for 961 small basins and 8 major basins over the conterminous United States (CONUS). Relative bias, anomaly correlation and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) statistics at daily to annual time scales are used to assess model-simulated streamflow. The Noah (the Mosaic) model overestimates (underestimates) mean annual runoff and underestimates (overestimates) mean annual evapotranspiration. The SAC-SMA and VIC models simulate the mean annual runoff and evapotranspiration well when compared with the observations. The ensemble mean is closer to the mean annual observed streamflow for both the 961 small basins and the 8 major basins than is the mean from any individual model. All of the models, as well as the ensemble mean, have large daily, weekly, monthly, and annual streamflow anomaly correlations for most basins over the CONUS, implying strong simulation skill. However, the daily, weekly, and monthly NSE analysis results are not necessarily encouraging, in particular for daily streamflow. The Noah and Mosaic models are useful (NSE {\textgreater} 0.4) only for about 10\% of the 961 small basins, the SAC-SMA and VIC models are useful for about 30\% of the 961 small basins, and the ensemble mean is useful for about 42\% of the 961 small basins. As the time scale increases, the NSE increases as expected. However, even for monthly streamflow, the ensemble mean is useful for only 75\% of the 961 small basins.},

Predictive relationships describing the hydraulic parameter distributions must be developed based on the common descriptors of the physical properties of soils (e.g., texture, structure, particle size distribution). Covariation among the hydraulic parameters within these relationships must be identified. Data for 1448 soil samples were examined in an evaluation of the usefulness of qualitative descriptors as predictors of soil hydraulic behavior. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression techniques were used to derive quantitative expressions for the moments of the hydraulic parameters as functions of the particle size distributions (percent sand, silt, and clay content) of soils. Discriminant analysis suggests that the covariation of the hydraulic parameters can be used to construct a classification scheme based on the hydraulic behavior of soils that is analogous to the textural classification scheme based on the sand, silt, and clay content of soils.},

	abstract = {Phase 2 of the Distributed Model Intercomparison Project (DMIP 2) was formulated primarily as a mechanism to help guide the US National Weather Service (NWS) as it expands its use of spatially distributed watershed models for operational river, flash flood, and water resources forecasting. The overall purpose of DMIP 2 was to test many distributed models with operational quality data with a view towards meeting NWS operational forecasting needs. At the same time, DMIP 2 was formulated as an experiment that could be leveraged by the broader scientific community as a platform for testing, evaluating, and improving the science of spatially distributed models. This paper presents the key results of the DMIP 2 experiments conducted for the Oklahoma region, which included comparison of lumped and distributed model simulations generated with uncalibrated and calibrated parameters, water balance tests, routing and soil moisture tests, and simulations at interior locations. Simulations from 14 independent groups and 16 models are analyzed. As in DMIP 1, the participant simulations were evaluated against observed hourly streamflow data and compared with simulations generated by the NWS operational lumped model. A wide range of statistical measures are used to evaluate model performance on both run-period and event basis. A noteworthy improvement in DMIP 2 was the combined use of two lumped models to form the benchmark for event improvement statistics, where improvement was measured in terms of runoff volume, peak flow, and peak timing for between 20 and 40 events in each basin. Results indicate that in general, those spatially distributed models that are calibrated to perform well for basin outlet simulations also, in general, perform well at interior points whose drainage areas cover a wide range of scales. Two of the models were able to provide reasonable estimates of soil moisture versus depth over a wide geographic domain and through a period containing two severe droughts. In several parent and interior basins, a few uncalibrated spatially distributed models were able to achieve better goodness-of-fit statistics than other calibrated distributed models, highlighting the strength of those model structures combined with their a priori parameters. In general, calibration solely at basin outlets alone was not able to greatly improve relative model performance beyond that established by using uncalibrated a priori parameters. Further, results from the experiment for returning DMIP 1 participants reinforce the need for stationary data for model calibration: in some cases, the improvements gained by distributed models compared to lumped were not realized when the models were calibrated using inconsistent precipitation data from DMIP 1. Event-average improvement of distributed models over the combined lumped benchmark was measured in terms of runoff volume, peak flow, and peak timing for between 20 and 40 events. The percentage of model-basin pairs having positive distributed model improvement at basin outlets and interior points was 18\%, 24\%, and 28\% respectively, for these quantities. These values correspond to 14\%, 33\%, and 22\% respectively, in DMIP 1. While there may not seem to be much gain compared to DMIP 1 results, the DMIP 2 values were based on more precipitation–runoff events, more model-basin combinations (148 versus 51), more interior ungauged points (9 versus 3), and a benchmark comprised of two lumped model simulations. In addition, we propose a set of statistical measures that can be used to guide the calibration of distributed and lumped models for operational forecasting.},

	abstract = {Abstract Data from the 1987 summer FIFE experiment for four pairs of days are compared with corresponding 48-h forecasts from two different versions of the Eta Model, both initialized from the NCEP–NCAR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research) global reanalysis. One used the late 1995 operational Eta Model physics, the second, with a new soil and land surface scheme and revisions to the surface layer and boundary layer schemes, used the physics package that became operational on 31 January 1996. Improvements in the land surface parameterization and its interaction with the atmosphere are one key to improved summer precipitation forecasts. The new soil thermal model is an improvement over the earlier slab soil model, although the new skin temperature generally now has too large a diurnal cycle (whereas the old surface temperature had too small a diurnal cycle) and is more sensitive to net radiation errors. The nighttime temperature minima are often too low, because of a model underestimate of the downwelling radiation, despite improvements in the coupling of the surface and boundary layer at night. The daytime incoming solar radiation has a substantial high bias in both models, because of some coding errors (which have now been corrected), insufficient atmospheric shortwave absorption, and underestimates of cloud. The authors explore evaporation before and after a midsummer heavy rain event with the two models. The late 1995 operational model uses a soil moisture bucket physics, with a specified annual-mean fixed field soil moisture climatology, so the surface evaporation responds primarily to the atmospheric forcing. While the surface fluxes in the new model show this strong rain event more dramatically, because its soil moisture comes from the global reanalysis rather than climatology, there remain problems with soil moisture initialization. It appears that a fully continuous Eta data assimilation system (which is under development), likely with more than two soil layers and assimilation of observed hourly precipitation, will be needed to get an adequate soil moisture initialization. Evaporation in the new two-layer soil model falls too much from forecast day 1 to day 2, as the first shallow 10-cm layer dries out (as it also does in the 1995 model with the bucket physics). This appears to be related to the specified low vegetation fraction and the bare soil evaporation model. Although the new boundary layer scheme is better coupled to the surface at night, both versions underestimate entrainment at the top of the mixed layer. The improvement in the surface evaporation resulting from using a climatological green vegetation fraction (derived from satellite data) and a revised bare soil evaporation formulation are shown. These changes were incorporated in a model physics revision in February 1997. An encouraging result from one case study, when it rained in the model, shows that the interaction between the surface, boundary layer, and convection schemes during precipitation is satisfactory, although the model underestimates the impact of cloud cover on the incoming solar radiation.},

	abstract = {A parametric water balance model was developed based on statistical averaging of the main hydrological processes. The model has a two-layer structure with both a physical and statistical basis for the model parameters. It was developed to fill a need for models with a small number of parameters and of intermediate complexity between a one-parameter simple bucket and more complex hydrologically oriented models with many parameters such as the Sacramento model. The focus was to improve the representation of runoff relative to the simple bucket without introducing the full complexity of the Sacramento model. The model was designed to operate over a range of time steps to facilitate coupling to an atmospheric model. The model can be used for catchment scale simulations in hydrological applications and for simple representation of runoff in coupled atmospheric/hydrological models. An important role for the simple water balance (SWB) model is to assist in understanding how much complexity in representing land surface processes is needed and can be supported with available data to estimate model parameters. The model is tested using rainfall, runoff, and surface meteorological data for three catchments from different climate regimes. Model performance is compared to performance of a simple bucket model, the Sacramento model, and the Oregon State University land surface model. Finally, a series of tests were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of SWB performance when it is operated at time steps different from the time step for which it was calibrated.},

	abstract = {Attempts to correlate values of stomatal conductance and leaf water potential with particular environmental variables in the field are generally of only limited success because they are simultaneously affected by a number of environmental variables. For example, correlations between leaf water potential and either flux of radiant energy or vapour pressure deficit show a diurnal hysteresis which leads to a scatter diagram if many values are plotted. However, a simple model may be adequate to relate leaf water potential to the flow of water through the plant. The stomatal conductance of illuminated leaves is a function of current levels of temperature, vapour pressure deficit, leaf water potential (really turgor pressure) and ambient CO2 concentration. Consequently, when plotted against any one of these variables a scatter diagram results. Physiological knowledge of stomatal functioning is not adequate to provide a mechanistic model linking stomatal conductance to all these variables. None the less, the parameters describing the relationships with the variables can be conveniently estimated from field data by a technique of non-linear least squares, for predictive purposes and to describe variations in response from season to season and plant to plant.},

Explicit expressions for the stability-dependent, surface exchange coefficient developed by Louis are used. The diurnal variation of potential evaporation is computed for the stability-dependent and original Penman relationships using Wangara data. The influence of afternoon instability increases the aerodynamic term of the modified Penman relationship by 50\% or more on days with moderate instability. However, the unmodified Penman relationship predicts values of daily potential evaporation close to that of the stability-dependent relationship. This agreement is partly due to compensating overestimation during nighttime hours. Errors due to use of daily-averaged variables are examined in detail by evaluating the nonlinear interactions between the diurnal variation of the variables in the Penman relationship. A simpler method for estimating the exchange coefficient is constructed from an empirical relationship between the radiation Richardson number and the Obukhov length. This method is less accurate, but it allows estimation of the stability-dependent exchange coefficient using only parameters already required for evaluation of the Penman relationship. Finally, the diurnal variation of the atmospheric resistance coefficient appearing in the Penman-Monteith relationship is presented.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Simple Biosphere Model (SiB) as described in Sellers et al. is a bio-physically based model of land surface-atmosphere interaction. For some general circulation model (GCM) climate studies, further simplifications are desirable to have greater computation efficiency, and more important, to consolidate the parametric representation. Three major reductions in the complexity of SiB have been achieved in the present study. The diurnal variation of surface albedo is computed in SiB by means of a comprehensive yet complex calculation. Since the diurnal cycle is quite regular for each vegetation type, this calculation can be simplified considerably. The effect of root zone soil moisture on stomatal resistance is substantial, but the computation in SiB is complicated and expensive. We have developed approximations, which simulate the effects of reduced soil moisture more simply, keeping the essence of the biophysical concepts used in SiB. The surface stress and the fluxes of heat and moisture between the top of the vegetation canopy and an atmospheric reference level have been parameterized in an off-line version of SiB based upon the studies by Businger et al. and Paulson. We have developed a linear relationship between Richardson number and aero-dynamic resistance. Finally, the second vegetation layer of the original model does not appear explicitly after simplification. Compared to the model of Sellers et al., we have reduced the number of input parameters from 44 to 21. A comparison of results using the reduced parameter biosphere with those from the original formulation in a GCM and a zero-dimensional model shows the simplified version to reproduce the original results quite closely. After simplification, the computational requirement of SiB was reduced by about 55\%.},

The differences inthese three schemes and the resulting surface exchange coefficients do not, in general, lead to significant differences in model simulated surface fluxes, skin temperature, andprecipitation, provided the same treatment of roughness length for heat is employed.Rather, the model is more sensitive to the choice of the roughness length for heat. To assess the latter, we also tested two approaches to specifythe roughness length for heat: 1) assuming the roughness length for heat is a fixed ratio of the roughness length for momentum, and 2) relating this ratio to the roughness Reynolds number as proposed by Zilitinkevich.Our 1-D column model sensitivity tests suggested that the Zilitinkevich approach can improve the surface heat fluxand skin temperature simulations. A long-term test with the NCEP mesoscaleEta model indicated that this approach can also reduce forecast precipitation bias. Based on these simulations, in January 1996 we operationally implemented the Paulsonscheme with the new land-surface scheme of the NCEP Eta model, along with the Zilitinkevich formulation to specify the roughness length for heat.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Results are used to evaluate the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast Systems (GFS) parameterization and several new parameterizations derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The influence of clouds on surface albedo and the albedo difference between morning and afternoon observations are also investigated. A new approach is taken to partition the observed upward flux so that the direct-beam and diffuse albedos can be separately computed. The study focused first on the ARM Southern Great Plains Central Facility site. It is found that the diffuse albedo prescribed in the NCEP GFS matched closely with the observations. The direct-beam albedo parameterized in the GFS is largely underestimated at all SZAs. The parameterizations derived from the MODIS product underestimated the direct-beam albedo at large SZAs and slightly overestimated it at small SZAs. Similar results are obtained from the analyses of observations at other stations. It is also found that the morning and afternoon dependencies of direct-beam albedo on SZA differ among the stations. Attempts are made to improve numerical model algorithms that parameterize the direct-beam albedo as a product of the direct-beam albedo at SZA = 60° (or the diffuse albedo), which varies with surface type or geographical location and/or season, and a function that depends only on SZA. A method is presented for computing the direct-beam albedos over these snow-free land points without referring to a particular land-cover classification scheme, which often differs from model to model.},

	abstract = {Abstract A negative snow water equivalent (SWE) bias in the snow model of the Noah land surface scheme used in the NCEP suite of numerical weather and climate prediction models has been noted by several investigators. This bias motivated a series of offline tests of model extensions and improvements intended to reduce or eliminate the bias. These improvements consist of changes to the model’s albedo formulation that include a parameterization for snowpack aging, changes to how pack temperature is computed, and inclusion of a provision for refreeze of liquid water in the pack. Less extensive testing was done on the performance of model extensions with alternate areal depletion parameterizations. Model improvements were evaluated through comparisons of point simulations with National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) SWE data for deep-mountain snowpacks at selected stations in the western United States, as well as simulations of snow areal extent over the conterminous United States (CONUS) domain, compared with observational data from the NOAA Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS). The combination of snow-albedo decay and liquid-water refreeze results in substantial improvements in the magnitude and timing of peak SWE, as well as increased snow-covered extent at large scales. Modifications to areal snow depletion thresholds yielded more realistic snow-covered albedos at large scales.},

	abstract = {Abstract A unified land model (ULM) is described that combines the surface flux parameterizations in the Noah land surface model (used in most of NOAA’s coupled weather and climate models) with the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model (Sac; used for hydrologic prediction within the National Weather Service). The motivation was to develop a model that has a history of strong hydrologic performance while having the ability to be run in the coupled land–atmosphere environment. ULM takes the vegetation, snow model, frozen soil, and evapotranspiration schemes from Noah and merges them with the soil moisture accounting scheme from Sac. ULM surface fluxes, soil moisture, and streamflow simulations were evaluated through comparisons with observations from the Ameriflux (surface flux), Illinois Climate Network (soil moisture), and Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX; streamflow) datasets. Initially, a priori parameters from Sac and Noah were used, which resulted in ULM surface flux simulations that were comparable to those produced by Noah (Sac does not predict surface energy fluxes). ULM with the a priori parameters had streamflow simulation skill that was generally similar to Sac’s, although it was slightly better (worse) for wetter (more arid) basins. ULM model performance using a set of parameters identified via a Monte Carlo search procedure lead to substantial improvements relative to the a priori parameters. A scheme for transfer of parameters from streamflow simulations to nearby flux and soil moisture measurement points was also evaluated; this approach did not yield conclusive improvements relative to the a priori parameters.},

	abstract = {The process of a model adjusting to its forcing (model spin-up) can severely bias land surface simulations, and result in questionable land surface model (LSM) output during the spin-up process. To gain a better understanding of how spin-up processes affect complex spatial and temporal land surface modeling situations in general, and the Retrospective North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) simulations in particular, a two-phase study was conducted. The first phase examined results from Control, Wet, and Dry 11 year-long Mosaic simulations, while the second phase attempted to explain spin-up behavior in NLDAS Retrospective simulations from the Mosaic, Noah, VIC and Sacramento LSMs based in part on the results from phase 1. Total column and root zone soil moisture spin up slowly, while evaporation and deep soil temperature spin up more quickly. Mosaic soil moisture initialization with NCEP/DOE Global Reanalysis 2 (NCEP/DOE R-2) data (Control run) leads to a faster spin-up time than saturated (Wet run) or dry (Dry run) initialization, with the Control run reaching equilibrium 1 to 2 years sooner than the Wet run and 3 to 4 years more quickly than the Dry run. Overall, practical drift of land surface stores and output ceased in the Control run within approximately 1 year, and fine-scale equilibrium was reached within 5.5 years. Spin-up times exhibited large spatial variability, and although no single causal factor could be determined, they were correlated most strongly with precipitation and temperature forcing. In general, NLDAS models reach a state of rough equilibrium within the first 1 to 2 years of the 3-year Retrospective simulation. The Sacramento LSM has the shortest spin-up phase, followed by the Mosaic, VIC, and Noah LSMs. Initial NCEP/DOE R-2 conditions were too dry in general for the VIC and Noah LSMs, and too moist for the Mosaic and Sacramento LSMs. These results indicate that in most cases, the 1-year spin-up time used in the Retrospective NLDAS simulations eliminated spin-up problems from the subsequent period that was used for analysis.},

Published values for the effective roughness lengths of heat and momentum from different origins are used to show the impact on the surface fluxes and the boundary layer development. The modal simulations indicate that the coupled atmosphere-vegetation system is rather sensitive to the value for the roughness length of heat. This affects in particular the sensible heat flux and, as a consequence, the boundary layer height and profiles of mean quantities in the boundary layer. The model results are compared with observations made at a forest town, with radiosonde profiles, and with aircraft data. The best overall agreement for the boundary layer quantities is obtained by using a roughness length of heat that is three orders of magnitude smaller than the roughness length of momentum.},

	abstract = {A parameterization of land surface processes to be included in mesoscale and large-scale meteorological models is presented. The number of parameters has been reduced as much as possible, while attempting to preserve the representation of the physics which controls the energy and water budgets. We distinguish two main classes of parameters. The spatial distribution of primary parameters, i.e., the dominant types of soil and vegetation within each grid cell, can be specified from existing global datasets. The secondary parameters, describing the physical properties of each type of soil and vegetation, can be inferred from measurements or derived from numerical experiments. A single surface temperature is used to represent the surface energy balance of the land/cover system. The soil heat flux is linearly interpolated between its value over bare ground and a value of zero for complete shielding by the vegetation. The ground surface moisture equation includes the effect of gravity and the thermo-hydric coefficients of the equations have been either calculated or calibrated using textural dependent formulations. The calibration has been made using the results of a detailed soil model forced by prescribed atmospheric mean conditions. The results show that the coefficients of the surface soil moisture equation are greatly dependent upon the textural class of the soil, as well as upon its moisture content. The new scheme has been included in a one-dimensional model which allows a complete interaction between the surface and the atmosphere. Several simulations have been performed using data collected during HAPEX-MOBILHY. These first results show the ability of the parameterization to reproduce the components of the surface energy balance over a wide variety of surface conditions.},

	abstract = {A generalization of the single soil layer variable infiltration capacity (VIC) land surface hydrological model previously implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory general circulation model (GCM) is described. The new model is comprised of a two-layer characterization of the soil column, and uses an aerodynamic representation of the latent and sensible heat fluxes at the land surface. The infiltration algorithm for the upper layer is essentially the same as for the single layer VIC model, while the lower layer drainage formulation is of the form previously implemented in the Max-Planck-Institut GCM. The model partitions the area of interest (e.g., grid cell) into multiple land surface cover types; for each land cover type the fraction of roots in the upper and lower zone is specified. Evapotranspiration consists of three components: canopy evaporation, evaporation from bare soils, and transpiration, which is represented using a canopy and architectural resistance formulation. Once the latent heat flux has been computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to solve for the land surface temperature at each time step. The model was tested using long-term hydrologic and climatological data for Kings Creek, Kansas to estimate and validate the hydrological parameters, and surface flux data from three First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment intensive field campaigns in the summer-fall of 1987 to validate the surface energy fluxes.},

Machine learning (ML) provides data-driven approaches to model and predict the dynamics of such systems. A core issue with this approach is that ML models are typically trained on discrete data, using ML methodologies that are not aware of underlying continuity properties. This results in models that often do not capture any underlying continuous dynamics—either of the system of interest, or indeed of any related system. To address this challenge, we develop a convergence test based on numerical analysis theory. Our test verifies whether a model has learned a function that accurately approximates an underlying continuous dynamics. Models that fail this test fail to capture relevant dynamics, rendering them of limited utility for many scientific prediction tasks; while models that pass this test enable both better interpolation and better extrapolation in multiple ways. Our results illustrate how principled numerical analysis methods can be coupled with existing ML training/testing methodologies to validate models for science and engineering applications.},

The relationships between mean monthly precipitation and total runoff are stronger in the Sacramento (SAC) and variable infiltration capacity (VIC) models, which grew out of the hydrological community, than in the Noah and Mosaic models, which grew out of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) community. The reverse is true for the relationship between mean monthly precipitation and evapotranspiration. In addition, surface energy fluxes in VIC are less sensitive to model forcing (except for air temperature) than those in the Noah and Mosaic model. Notwithstanding these general conclusions, the relationships between forcings and model-simulated water and energy fluxes for all models vary for different seasons, variables, and regions. These findings will ultimately inspire a combination of SVAT-type model energy components with hydrological model water components to develop a SVAT-hydrology model to improve both evapotranspiration and total runoff simulations.

Various input parameters for soil water properties including effective saturation, residual water content, anerobiosis point, field capacity, and permanent wilting point are incorporated into functions describing soil water retention, hydraulic conductivity, diffusivity, sorptivity, and the plant sink function. The perception of the meaning of these values and their variation within a natural environment often differs from the perspective of the soil physicist, plant physiologist, and atmospheric scientist. This article investigates the sensitivity of energy balance and boundary layer simulation to different soil water property functions using the Oregon State University coupled atmosphere-plant-soil (CAPS) simulation model under bare soil conditions. The soil parameterizations tested in the CAPS model include those of Clapp and Hornberger [1978], van Genuchten [1980], and Cosby et al. [1984] using initial atmospheric conditions from June 16, 1986 in Hydrologic Atmospheric Pilot Experiment-Modélisation du Bilan Hydrique (HAPEX-MOBILHY). For the bare soil case these results demonstrate unexpected model sensitivity to soil water property parameterization in partitioning all components of the diurnal energy balance and corresponding boundary layer development.},

	abstract = {Fraction of green vegetation, fg, and green leaf area index, Lg, are needed as a regular space-time gridded input to evapotranspiration schemes in the two National Weather Service (NWS) numerical prediction models regional Eta and global medium range forecast. This study explores the potential of deriving these two variables from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Obviously, one NDVI measurement does not allow simultaneous derivation of both vegetation variables. Simple models of a satellite pixel are used to illustrate the ambiguity resulting from a combination of the unknown horizontal (fg) and vertical (Lg) densities. We argue that for NOAA AVHRR data sets based on observations with a spatial resolution of a few kilometres the most appropriate way to resolve this ambiguity is to assume that the vegetated part of a pixel is covered by dense vegetation (i.e., its leaf area index is high), and to calculate fg=(NDVI-NDVI0)/(NDVI8-NDVI0), where NDVIo (bare soil) and NDVI (dense vegetation) are specified as global constants independent of vegetation/soil type. Global (0.15o)2 spatial resolution monthly maps of fg were produced from a 5-year NDVI climatology and incorporated in the NWS models. As a result, the model surface fluxes were improved.},

SiB consists of three submodels which describe the roles of radiative transfer, turbulent transfer and surface resistance in determining the energy balance of the vegetated land surface. These three submodels were detached from SiB and used on the SiB parameter set (total and green leaf area index, leaf angle orientation, canopy dimensions, etc.) to calculate global monthly fields of albedo, roughness length and minimum stomatal resistance at 1° × 1° resolution. Time series of various parameters are also displayed for each vegetation type for specified grid points. The SiB results compare reasonably well with appropriate measurements obtained from the literature and have the additional merit of being mutually consistent; the three submodels use many common parameters, which ensures that, for each grid area, the calculated surface properties are closely interrelated as is the case in nature. The derived fields provide a check on the operation of the submodels and the correctness of the parameter set. They can also be used as prescribed fields for GCMs that do not have biophysically based land surface parameterizations.},

This map will be included as an at-launch product of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to serve as an input for several algorithms requiring knowledge of land cover type. The methodology was derived from a similar effort to create a product at 8 km spatial resolution, where high resolution data sets were interpreted in order to derive a coarse-resolution training data set. A set of 37 294 x 1 km pixels was used within a hierarchical tree structure to classify the AVHRR data into 12 classes. The approach taken involved a hierarchy of pair-wise class trees where a logic based on vegetation form was applied until all classes were depicted. Multitemporal AVHRR metrics were used to predict class memberships. Minimum annual red reflectance, peak annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and minimum channel three brightness temperature were among the most used metrics. Depictions of forests and woodlands, and areas of mechanized agriculture are in general agreement with other sources of information, while classes such as low biomass agriculture and high-latitude broadleaf forest are not. Comparisons of the final product with regional digital land cover maps derived from high-resolution remotely sensed data reveal general agreement, except for apparently poor depictions of temperate pastures within areas of agriculture. Distinguishing between forest and non-forest was achieved with agreements ranging from 81 to 92\% for these regional subsets. The agreements for all classes varied from an average of 65\% when viewing all pixels to an average of 82\% when viewing only those 1 km pixels consisting of greater than 90\% one class within the high-resolution data sets.},

The proposed Time-Series Machine-Learning Error Modeling (T-MLEM) method constructs a regression model that maps features – which comprise error indicators that are derived from standard a posteriori error-quantification techniques – to a random variable for the approximate-solution error at each time instance. The proposed framework considers a wide range of candidate features, regression methods, and additive noise models. We consider primarily recursive regression techniques developed for time-series modeling, including both classical time-series models (e.g., autoregressive models) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), but also analyze standard non-recursive regression techniques (e.g., feed-forward neural networks) for comparative purposes. Numerical experiments conducted on multiple benchmark problems illustrate that the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, which is a type of RNN, outperforms other methods and yields substantial improvements in error predictions over traditional approaches.},

We formulate our model reduction problem as a maximum-likelihood problem, in which we look for the model that minimizes, in a class of candidate models, the error on the available inputoutput pairs. Speciﬁcally, we represent candidate models by means of ANNs, which we train to learn the dynamics of the HF model from the training input-output data. We prove that ANN models are able to approximate every time-dependent model described by ODEs with any desired level of accuracy. We test the proposed technique on diﬀerent problems, including the model reduction of two large-scale models. One of the HF systems of ODEs here considered stems from the spatial discretization of a parabolic PDE, which sheds light on a promising ﬁeld of application of the proposed technique.},

The goals of such efforts revolve around the generation of models for prediction, characterization, and control of complex systems. In the context of physics and engineering, extrapolation and generalization are critical aspects of model discovery that are empowered by various aspects of parsimony. Parsimony can be encoded (i) in a low-dimensional coordinate system, (ii) in the representation of governing equations, or (iii) in the representation of parametric dependencies. In what follows, we illustrate techniques that leverage parsimony in deep learning to build physics-based models, culminating in a deep learning architecture that is parsimonious in coordinates and also in representing the dynamics and their parametric dependence through a simple normal form. Ultimately, we argue that promoting parsimony in machine learning results in more physical models, i.e., models that generalize and are parametrically represented by governing equations.},

	abstract = {A majority of methods from dynamical systems analysis, especially those in applied settings, rely on Poincar{\textbackslash}'e's geometric picture that focuses on "dynamics of states". While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail. We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths, in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.},

	abstract = {Modern generative machine learning models demonstrate surprising ability to create realistic outputs far beyond their training data, such as photorealistic artwork, accurate protein structures, or conversational text. These successes suggest that generative models learn to effectively parametrize and sample arbitrarily complex distributions. Beginning half a century ago, foundational works in nonlinear dynamics used tools from information theory to infer properties of chaotic attractors from time series, motivating the development of algorithms for parametrizing chaos in real datasets. In this perspective, we aim to connect these classical works to emerging themes in large-scale generative statistical learning. We first consider classical attractor reconstruction, which mirrors constraints on latent representations learned by state space models of time series. We next revisit early efforts to use symbolic approximations to compare minimal discrete generators underlying complex processes, a problem relevant to modern efforts to distill and interpret black-box statistical models. Emerging interdisciplinary works bridge nonlinear dynamics and learning theory, such as operator-theoretic methods for complex fluid flows, or detection of broken detailed balance in biological datasets. We anticipate that future machine learning techniques may revisit other classical concepts from nonlinear dynamics, such as transinformation decay and complexity-entropy tradeoffs.},

The methods were chosen because they are easy to use and require only the main hysteresis curves of the soil-water characteristic to generate all higher-order curves. Two methods, the Point and Slope methods, showed considerable pumping when the soil-water pressure was cycled between − 36 and − 25 cm for a typical soil. These methods would not be satisfactory when numerous wetting-drying cycles are to be modeled. None of the methods was consistently better than the others for simulating primary wetting or drying curves for three test soils. Also, each method performed equally well when used as part of a numerical model for simulating hysteretic flow. However, because of the simplicity of use and limited storage requirements, the Linear method appears to be the method of choice for calculating the hysteretic differential soil-water capacity for most modeling applications.},

	abstract = {State-space models have been successfully used for more than ﬁfty years in different areas of science and engineering. We present a procedure for efﬁcient variational Bayesian learning of nonlinear state-space models based on sparse Gaussian processes. The result of learning is a tractable posterior over nonlinear dynamical systems. In comparison to conventional parametric models, we offer the possibility to straightforwardly trade off model capacity and computational cost whilst avoiding overﬁtting. Our main algorithm uses a hybrid inference approach combining variational Bayes and sequential Monte Carlo. We also present stochastic variational inference and online learning approaches for fast learning with long time series.},

	abstract = {The core principle of Variational Inference (VI) is to convert the statistical inference problem of computing complex posterior probability densities into a tractable optimization problem. This property enables VI to be faster than several sampling-based techniques. However, the traditional VI algorithm is not scalable to large data sets and is unable to readily infer out-of-bounds data points without re-running the optimization process. Recent developments in the field, like stochastic-, black box-, and amortized-VI, have helped address these issues. Generative modeling tasks nowadays widely make use of amortized VI for its efficiency and scalability, as it utilizes a parameterized function to learn the approximate posterior density parameters. In this paper, we review the mathematical foundations of various VI techniques to form the basis for understanding amortized VI. Additionally, we provide an overview of the recent trends that address several issues of amortized VI, such as the amortization gap, generalization issues, inconsistent representation learning, and posterior collapse. Finally, we analyze alternate divergence measures that improve VI optimization.},
