                              Time Format          updated 5/24/2004


The time format is pretty obvious to me but that doesn't help
the average person.

    sec = seconds
    min = minute
    hr  = hour
    d   = day
    mon = month
    yr = year
    decade = 10 years
    normal = climatology (WMO standard is 30 years)

    anl = analysis
    ave = average
    diff = difference
    fcst  = forecast
    rms = averaged rms value
    fcst clim = forecast climatology (see Nave for number of years)
    same-hour,rms = averaged rms value only using quantities
         with the same hour/minute as reference time

ex.
    ave@1d = average taken at 1 day intervals
           The number in the average is Nave
    ave@1yr = average taken at 1 year intervals
           (this replaces "clim" notation)
    rms@1yr = average RMS value with average taken
           on values 1 year apart


------------ removed 5/25/2004 ----------------
    clim  = climatology  (average over N years)
    clim (diurnal) = climatology (average over N years, hour important)
