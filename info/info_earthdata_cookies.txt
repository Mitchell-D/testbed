For sessions with many downloads, Earthdata prevents the need to
re-authenticate the user by facilitating the persistence of cookies
with a local configuration.

This involves 3 files: the .dodsrc, .netrc, and .urs_cookies in the
user's home directory, and an additional .dodsrc in the working
(project) directory.


Just touch .urs_cookies in the home directory

In .dodsrc:
```
HTTP.NETRC=<YourHomeDirectory>/.netrc
HTTP.COOKIEJAR=<YourHomeDirectory>/.urs_cookies
```

In .netrc:
```
machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov login <uid> password <password>" >> .netrc
```
Then set access to 0600 since it contains login information.
